# Notes on blogging

[Keysearch](https://www.keysearch.co/) can be used to look at keyworkds before choosing a title for an article.

There's also the [google search console](https://search.google.com/search-console?resource_id=sc-domain%3Aserialized.net). Use this for the URL Inspector to make sure canonical tags are working correctly.

Gotta make sure to set up canonical URLs (done), but check [this post](https://ahrefs.com/blog/canonical-tags/) for more info.
