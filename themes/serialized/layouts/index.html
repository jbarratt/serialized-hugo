	<p>Welcome! This site is where I write about things that have my attention. I'm a software and systems architect, husband and dad, tinkerer, home cook, coffee fan, musician, hiker, and could probably add a few other labels... all of those interests and more are fair game to show up here. If you want to know more, <a href="/about">check out the about page</a>, and otherwise, I hope you find something you like!</p>
