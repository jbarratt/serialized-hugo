On December 21, 2016 I opened my email to find one of the most unusual messages of my life:

<img src="/images/AcademyAwardLetter.png" width="80%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

I was officially an Academy Award winner. Merry Christmas. :evergreen_tree:

2 months later, I was on stage in a fancy ballroom in Beverly Hills, wearing a new tuxedo, and being handed a 24 carat gold plated award by John Cho:

And a few weeks later, my phone blew up when a lot of people I knew saw this photo on their TV's while they were watching the 2017 Academy Awards. Yes, that's me in the top left corner.

And now, I have this sitting on my bookshelf:

Most people don't know that I had anything to do with "the Movies", because I have had a very different career for the last decade. And now that I have received this very interesting and well known award, I'm being introduced as an "Academy Award Winner" suprisingly frequently, and needing to tell this story.

So for posterity, here is the tale of how those wonderful yet surreal events came to be.

---

The short version first: 

In 2002, I was hired by Steve Rosenbluth as the only other developer for a product that would come to be known as Overdrive. The product enabled live and recorded playback of performances, both to physical (giant robots) and computer graphics systems, and has now been used in over 60 feature films. I worked with Steve full and part time for nearly 4 years; after I left, Steve continued to move the work forward, and was eventually honored with the award. And Steve, being a truly kind and generous person, included me in it, due to my founding contributions.

---

And now, the much longer version.

In 2001, I was getting ready to graduate from UCLA with a Computer Science degree. It was the craziest part of the original "Dot Com Bubble". For example -- one day, I was walking down the sidewalk in Westwood and wearing a programming-related shirt. Someone pulled their car over, hopped out, and offered me a job on the spot. That kind of crazy time. In March, I had 3 incredible job offers to choose from. By the time I graduated a few months later, 2 of those companies had gone under, and another had kicked off layoffs and introduced a hiring freeze.

So, I moved home into a beaten up trailer in my family's back yard, and admittedly started to feel a little sorry for myself. (In retrospect, I'm very glad all this happened, 21 year old me needed the growth opportunity.)

I eventually found a local job in the paper, looking for developers with strong Linux experience. That, I could do. I'd been running Linux on my desktop all the way through school, was an active member of the LUG, and had worked as a Linux Sysadmin for ASUCLA, the organization that runs all the stores on campus, manages the branding, etc. I was hired at ComDev as a "Customer Service Engineer" -- to work with the customers that were going to be installing a complex combination of software and hardware for a cellular data service. (First generation LTE, essentially.)

The only challenge was, they never ended up with any customers. Which was good for me in one sense, as I got to fill in wherever people needed a hand around the building, and got experience with everything from embedded systems to large Java MVC applications to automating a massive day-long build process. But it was clear the company was struggling. They told us they planned to keep the company running for at least 3 more months, as there were several large customers on the verge of closing, but didn't know what would happen after that.

At the same time, I had fallen madly in love with the woman who I am fortunate to still be madly in love with (and married to.) She lived in LA, 4 hours south, and we wanted to see each other more often. So I asked around in the UCLA LUG's IRC channel, in which I still hung out, if anyone knew of good opportunites. A friend mentioned one of his co-workers had just left the Jim Henson Company to start his own thing, and was looking for a developer, and I should give him a call. I got my resume in order, had a phone interview with Steve on Thursday, and came in Friday morning to find out that, in fact, they'd decided to shut the business down that day, instead of in 3 months. 24 hours later, Steve called, and wanted to know if I could start on Monday. I sure can, Steve.

Steve is a truly incredible person. He has the best balances of drive, creativity, ethics and kindness I have ever found in the business world. He developed a passion for filmmaking and animatronics when very young, and has continued to live that dream out. I'm very fortunate to have had him as a mentor during those formative years of my engineering career.

Our first project was to build an animatronic horse for the film 'The Last Samurai'. At 50 seconds in you can see some of the 'behind the scenes', including the puppeteers using the Overdrive system to perform the horse in real time while Tom Cruise (and the stunt man) interacted with it.

While that video clip is short, it showed some of the features we developed for the first production use of the software.

* Puppeteers performing the horse in real time, using custom-built high precision controllers, so it could react to the actual movements of the performers and the live horses in the scene
* Using a full non-linear editor we built for the coordinated movements in the scene, like one horse coming down the track and colliding with the other.
* Extensive safety features, because injuring Tom Cruise is really not an option.

As a non-puppeteer engineer, I stayed home while the rest of the team went to New Zealand to work on the film, and continuted to work on features and fixes remotely. It was then that I went looking for a "day job" and found the web hosting company Media Temple for the first time, which has been my "other job" and home ever since. The founder of Media Temple, Demian Selfors, another incredible person I've been fortunate to work for, happened to have a background in special effects as well. He was the IT Director for the iconic Stan Winston Studios, probably best known for creating the Terminator, and the dinosaurs (robotic and CG) for Jurassic Park. So a few years later, when the Overdrive system kept being used on more and more projects, he understood when I went back to work on it full time.

Eventually we added many more capabilities to the system:

* Controlling the cabled flying cameras used at sporting events
* Driving computer graphics directly
* Adding sound to the non-linear editor
* Taking "data gloves" as input
* Adding wireless options for wearable "puppeteered costumes"
* Creating a sophisticated system to allow us to remotely support operators on set around the world

Unfortunately, the movie industry is a capricious master sometimes; you are at the whim of director's choices, writer's choices, writer's strikes, and as we faced, the increasing shift from practical effects to CG. At some point in 2004, things were looking very lean, and Demian called back to see if I could help him grow his business. It was time to move on.

I'm incredibly proud of Steve for continuting his mission, and rather than becoming a victim of the shift to computer graphics -- he evolved Overdrive to become a key part of today's digital moviemaking pipeline, as evidenced by the [impressive list of projects](http://conceptoverdrive.com/projects.php) Overdrive has been used on since. And I'm very grateful both that he included me in the award, and that he taught me lessons about quality, safety, ethics, community, and leadership that I try and live up to in my work every day.
