I found a perl module today which made me disproportionately happy; thus, I decided to share.

[MIME::Lite](http://search.cpan.org/~rjbs/MIME-Lite-3.020/lib/MIME/Lite.pm)

Check out, specifically, the example of sending email "with images attached".

I'm now able to quickly blast myself summary emails including exciting things like visual maps of the data, etc. I'm sure the evil amongst us would appreciate this tool for <em>other</em> reasons, but we'll ignore the evil for now.
