I've been working with [xnee](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/xnee/) to do regression tests on a GUI application. I kept running into a problem though -- when I played back an xnee session, it would play back fine -- but afterward, my X session would behave really strangely. Trying to type 'ls' into a terminal would cause it to exit or clear the screen or other odd behaviors.

**Update:**I heard back from hesa, xnee's author, who said this will be fixed in the next release. Good to hear...
