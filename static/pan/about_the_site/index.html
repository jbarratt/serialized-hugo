        <h1>About this site</h1>
        
        <p>I grew up in a very God-believing home and community, and that&#39;s no longer the case. I wrote what is probably too much about that in the <a href="/pan/about_me/">&#39;About Me&#39;</a> page.</p>
        
        <p>Since I came out as an <a href="/pan/naming_is_hard">atheist</a>, I&#39;ve been involved in a lot of conversations (face to face, phone, electronic mail, etc) with friends, family, and the faithful. At this point, many of these conversations are covering ground that I&#39;ve covered at some length in the past; and yet, the conversations keep happening. So, one reason for making this site is sheer laziness. I can direct people here, where my evidence and reasoning, as flawed as it certainly is, is on display.</p>
        
        <p>The potential that my reasoning is flawed is another reason to publish all of this. Given the choice to be &#39;correct&#39; or &#39;incorrect&#39;, I&#39;ll choose &#39;correct.&#39; I&#39;ve changed a lot to get here, and I&#39;ll be really disappointed if I don&#39;t get to learn I&#39;ve been wrong about more things in the future. So, it&#39;s a place to trap errors, missing evidence and logical fallacies.</p>
        
        <p>The third big reason is that I&#39;ve been exploring the &#39;big questions&#39; -- how did we get here, where might we be going, what&#39;s the explanation for all this mess -- for a while now, so this is also functioning as a kind of journal of discovery.</p>
        
        <h3>What&#39;s with the name?</h3>
        
        <p>As I <a href="/pan/naming_is_hard">discuss</a> <a href="/pan/probabalistic_parenting/">a</a> <a href="/pan/faithache/">lot</a>, I think probabilities are about the only useful way to try and come to grips with the world. And, as far as I&#39;ve been able to discover, it&#39;s the most probable explanation (of all the theories I&#39;ve yet explored) that this world, the origins of live, the origins of the universe -- are all natural. Not Supernatural. Not any one of the thousands of versions of God that humanity have believed in over the ages. But, I&#39;m not sure, and I don&#39;t think anyone can be <em>sure</em>.</p>
        
        <p>So, it&#39;s &quot;Probably All Natural.&quot;</p>
