<blockquote>
<p>I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of heaven like a little child will never enter it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a terrific scripture to use against the pursuit of knowledge. Christians often warn against thinking one is smarter than God.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Ways Christianity (as an idea) protects itself</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>If Christianity is a false belief, as you claim, then why is it so popular? Why do so many people hold to it? Isn&#39;t that an argument for it&#39;s validity?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s an argument for it&#39;s <strong>effectiveness</strong>. The beliefs of and cultures around Christianity have been undeniably numerically effective. If they are true or not is a different question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the things that help keep Christian faith together are from God&#39;s inspired scriptures, that&#39;s how they work!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One does not follow from the other.</p>

<ol>
<li>There are many belief systems with many adherents, which between themselves have incompatible versions of &quot;God&quot;</li>
<li>Any belief system which has &#39;many&#39; adherents must have some means of having gathered and retained those members</li>
<li>Since multiple religions have such means, any one religion having them is not evidence of the inspiration/truth/Godly Origin of that religion.</li>
</ol>

<p>But it raises an interesting question -- why <em>do</em> so many people believe in Christianity? Why, as an idea, has it been so &quot;sticky&quot;? I&#39;m sure there are many other factors, but here are some of the things that contributed to me holding on to it for as long as I did.</p>

<h3>Inspiration and Omnipotence</h3>

<p>This is a very powerful and often-used pairing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Everything in this scripture is from God</li>
<li>Do not question God, for God is eternal and his ways are not our ways. Questioning God is &#39;blasphemy&#39;, a first-class sin.</li>
</ol>

<p>TODO 2 Tim 3:16, &quot;his ways not ours&quot;, etc</p>

<p>This set of ideas leads to a few important effects.</p>

<p>Critical conversation about the scriptures and the God represented there is inherently taboo. By discussing some problematic aspect of the story, or by suggesting some parts are human in origin, we are immediately behaving &quot;immorally&quot;. Because even words that Paul, Matthew, Moses, and the other alleged authors of the Bible&#39;s books are said to have come directly from God to them, they are indisputable. I can suggest that perhaps Paul, a man, was acting in accordance with his cultural beliefs, which we&#39;ve learned are invalid. That&#39;s an easy conversation. But one does not so lightly say that God, using Paul as his vessel, was wrong about something.</p>

<p>Also, the idea that the <strong>whole</strong> scripture is inspired helps with bootstrapping faith. If I find one thing that I feel really confirms my faith -- for example, a fulfilled prophecy -- when paired with the &#39;all scripture is inspired&#39; idea, it endorses the whole thing. And by endorsing, it makes logical/historical/textual issues with other parts of the text easier to gloss over. &quot;I believe because of X, therefore, no matter how implausible, I must believe that the biblical flood is literal history.&quot;</p>

<p>One of my favorite ironies of the last few years (and you have to find funny where you can, in a process like this) was learning scholarly consensus is that 2 Timothy is a forgery. So, the verse which was quoted to me extremely frequently to validate this idea that God inspired every word? Probably written by an early church father pretending to be Paul.</p>

<h3>Social Isolation</h3>

<h4>Us vs Them</h4>

<p>The Bible (both Testaments) frequently uses language which divides the believers from the rest of the world.
We are the saved, the enlightened, the chosen -- the are the other, the ignorant, the damned, the untrustworthy, the evil.</p>

<p>This verse was quoted extremely frequently in my community, generally to justify removing ourselves from worldly influences -- media, friendships, education.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You adulterous people, don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. (<em>James 4:4</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not actually clear from the context that this &quot;isolation&quot; was what the writer was going for, but this is what it ended up being used for.</p>

<p>Ephesians reads a little more clearly on this point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed. (<em>Ephesians 4:17-19</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the &quot;other&quot; -- non-adherents, Gentiles -- are effectively marginalized. They&#39;re dumb, evil people who are wasting their lives.</p>

<p>So if some &quot;other&quot; came calling with an idea that challenges our beliefs, we can automatically write them off. They&#39;re just caught up in their own evil and darkened understanding. </p>

<h4>Family: it can be &#39;them&#39; too!</h4>

<p>Though Christianity is often linked to &#39;family values&#39;, it&#39;s clear what should take priority if family and belief come in to contrast:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him. A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.” “Who are my mother and my brothers?” he asked.  Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, “Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does God’s will is my brother and sister and mother.” (<em>Mark 3:31-35</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a double whammy for building a strong social fabric. You don&#39;t need your <strong>actual</strong> brother any more! He can get out of here with his Gentile ways. You have a new family now, and you get to be brothers with the mythic founder of our religion. That&#39;s an upgrade, right?</p>

<p>Jesus is reported as having gotten even more specific:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.  For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.  And a man&#39;s foes shall be they of his own household.  He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. (<em>Matthew 10:34-37</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your relationship with Jesus is more important than your relationship with your children.</p>

<h4>Godly Seed</h4>

<p>Another useful combination for keeping the religion going for a long time:</p>

<ol>
<li>Marry only believers</li>
<li>You&#39;re responsible for planting faith in your children</li>
</ol>

<p>Outside of the explicit instructions around &quot;Godly Seed&quot;, the God-centered family is programmed in from the earliest stories of the Old Testament. The stories of the Patriarchs and Kings were all ones which emphasized the power of, and responsibility to honor, family.</p>

<h4>Lifetime Commitment</h4>

<p>I <a href="/broken_promises/">wrote about</a> the power of asking for a lifetime commitment.</p>

<ul>
<li>You die, and are born again a new person. It&#39;s not a choice, it&#39;s a transformation.</li>
<li>You&#39;re a part of the &quot;bride of Christ&quot; -- there are frequent parallels to the act, and commitment level, of marriage.</li>
<li>Once making this choice, you become &quot;responsible&quot; (TODO worse for you than if you&#39;d never belieived)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Command Preaching</h3>

<p>&quot;Sharing the Gospel&quot; is not just a good idea, it&#39;s the law. If you&#39;d like to be saved, you need be about saving others. </p>

<p>This is a pretty basic formula which was adapted in the early years of Christianity out of necessity. When the king can&#39;t tell you what to believe anymore, to influence lots of people you need virality.</p>

<h3>Mental Defenses</h3>

<h4>Institutionalize Doubt</h4>

<p>The story of Thomas (TODO) gets used a lot to help ease the concerns of those experiencing doubt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have doubts!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s ok, even Thomas, who walked with our Lord, wanted to place his hand in the wounds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whew. I guess my doubts are ok.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By endorsing the doubts of even those extremely well equipped not to doubt, it makes one&#39;s doubts easier to live with. I might not &quot;believe-believe&quot;, I have some doubts, but that&#39;s ok -- I can stick around.</p>

<h4>Subvert Intuition</h4>

<p>Paul&#39;s well-developed ideas about the &quot;flesh man&quot; and &quot;spirit man&quot; (TODO) provide additional defenses against personal doubts. By modeling all thoughts which go against the teachings of the Church as being the voice of the &quot;Man of the Flesh&quot;, it allows them to be dismissed.</p>

<p>I actually would think along these lines while strugging, personifying (and therefore being able to marginalize) my doubts as &quot;fleshly thoughts.&quot;</p>

<h4>Demonize Rationality</h4>

<p>There are many, many passages which call out rationality and philosophy as fundamentally vain and evil.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge, which some have professed and in so doing have wandered from the faith. (<em>1 Timothy 6:20-21</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s fascinating that even at the time this was written there were already challenges on a rational basis.
Again, the separation and name-calling marginalization: &quot;godless chatter&quot;, &quot;<em>falsely</em> called knowledge&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ. (<em>Colossians 2:8</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter how good the ideas were, how valid the observations; the philosophy was &quot;hollow and deceptive.&quot;
Given the high probability that this letter was actually the creation of some new &quot;human traditions&quot;, it&#39;s another ironic reference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death. (<em>Proverbs 14:12</em>, <em>Proverbs 16:25</em>) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has similar functionality to the &quot;Flesh Man&quot;/&quot;Spirit Man&quot; dichotomy, while being even more explicit -- don&#39;t trust yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?  Tell Me, if you have understanding, Who set its measurements?  Since you know.  Or who stretched the line on it?”  (<em>Job 38:4-5</em>)</p>

<p>I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.  (<em>Isaiah 29:14</em>)</p>

<p>Where is the wise man?  Where is the scholar?  Where is the philosopher of this age?  Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?  For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. (<em>1 Corinthians 1:20-21</em>)</p>
