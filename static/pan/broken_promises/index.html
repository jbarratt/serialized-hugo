<blockquote>
<p>You made a lifetime commitment to your faith, then broke it. Doesn&#39;t that prove you&#39;re no longer trustworthy about anything else? What&#39;s stopping you from leaving your wife and kids tomorrow?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a reasonable objection to raise, if a little harsh.</p>

<p>Relationships and commitments are, and totally remain, really important to me. I&#39;m fiercely committed to my wife and my children. I&#39;m an outlier in today&#39;s employment landscape, having worked for a total of two companies since 2003.</p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;m fallible. I have lots and lots and lots of evidence for that. It&#39;s important to be able to <a href="/embrace_change/">deal with being wrong</a> and move on.</p>

<p>But being wrong about an idea in isolation -- one that just sits in your head, and doesn&#39;t impact anyone else -- is one thing. Being wrong about something that impacts others -- or one of your relationships -- is a whole other level. (Imagine making a bad medical choice which led to your child&#39;s death, for example -- yikes.) </p>

<p>There are a few reasons I can move on and forgive myself from having broken my commitment.</p>

<ol>
<li>Knowing more about the biochemistry that was going on in my brain at the time, and the strength of the <a href="/about_me/">way I was raised</a>, &quot;Me at age 19&quot; was objectively not the best suited to be making lifetime-impacting decisions. (The fact that the religious group even asks children to make a &quot;lifetime commitment&quot;, and frames it that way, is suspect, and is a <a href="/the_armor_of_faith/">part of the way it protects itself</a>).</li>
<li>My current understanding is that God does not exist. Of all the reasons to break a contract with someone, &quot;the other party turning out to not exist&quot; is a pretty good one.</li>
<li>My other commitments came in conflict with that commitment, and it was impossible to fulfill them all at the same time.</li>
</ol>

<p>To expand on the final point, having children was a major catalyst to drawing my prior religious commitment into question. I don&#39;t think I could have been a great parent while also trying to force myself to accept the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive-dissonance</a>-inducing beliefs I&#39;d previously subscribed to.</p>

<p>This is a pretty familiar problem to anyone that grows up and gets married; sometimes your &quot;top level relationship&quot; (your marriage) can put some strains on your &quot;second level relationships&quot; (parents, siblings, etc.)</p>

<p>I have every reason in the world to want to preserve, grow, adapt, and strengthen my relationships with my wife and children, (and all of our family!) and I&#39;ll fight for it. Especially since I now think it&#39;s probable that this life is the only one I&#39;ll have, having it be a good one for me and the people who depend on me is vital.</p></div>
