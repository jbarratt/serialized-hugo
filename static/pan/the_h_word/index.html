        <p>When I was growing up, the word &quot;humanist&quot; was used  with about the same kind of vocal intonation you might use saying words like &quot;rapist&quot; or &quot;pedophile&quot;. (I don&#39;t remember my parents playing that card, but others in my religious group certainly did.)</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>It&#39;s so obvious that God created the world and us. The arrogant <em>humanists</em> would have you believe that man evolved slowly over time so that they might exalt themselves...</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>... and so on.</p>
        
        <p>I don&#39;t have much to say about this beyond being startled to discover the seeming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_humanism">actual definition</a>:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>According to the Council for Secular Humanism, within the United States, the term &quot;secular humanism&quot; describes a world view with the following elements and principles:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Need to test beliefs</strong> – A conviction that dogmas, ideologies and traditions, whether religious, political or social, must be weighed and tested by each individual and not simply accepted by faith.</li>
        <li><strong>Reason, evidence, scientific method</strong> – A commitment to the use of critical reason, factual evidence and scientific method of inquiry in seeking solutions to human problems and answers to important human questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Fulfillment, growth, creativity</strong> – A primary concern with fulfillment, growth and creativity for both the individual and humankind in general.</li>
        <li><strong>Search for truth</strong> – A constant search for objective truth, with the understanding that new knowledge and experience constantly alter our imperfect perception of it.</li>
        <li><strong>This life</strong> – A concern for this life (as opposed to an afterlife) and a commitment to making it meaningful through better understanding of ourselves, our history, our intellectual and artistic achievements, and the outlooks of those who differ from us.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethics</strong> – A search for viable individual, social and political principles of ethical conduct, judging them on their ability to enhance human well-being and individual responsibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Justice and fairness</strong> – an interest in securing justice and fairness in society and in eliminating discrimination and intolerance.</li>
        <li><strong>Building a better world</strong> – A conviction that with reason, an open exchange of ideas, good will, and tolerance, progress can be made in building a better world for ourselves and our children.</li>
        </ul>
        </blockquote>
