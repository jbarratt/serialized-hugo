<blockquote>
<p>Of course you&#39;re going to find issues if you expect the Biblical account of creation to match up with reality! The Bible is not a history or science book, it&#39;s a book of moral stories and instruction. The Bible is a &quot;Why&quot; book, not a &quot;How&quot; book. It tells us the &#39;why&#39; through laws and metaphor and parables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This idea comes up a lot, generally when talking about the mismatches between the <a href="/pan/the_bible/creation/">creation stories</a> and observable reality.</p>

<p>There are a serious problems with this line of thinking, though.</p>

<p>First, the vast majority of Christians (if not all) expect that the Bible is more than just moral instruction. </p>

<p>It also does say something about how the world is:</p>

<ul>
<li>God exists, has certain characteristics, and created all things</li>
<li>God works in people&#39;s daily lives in some way (generally mysterious)</li>
<li>There is some way in which God provides &#39;salvation&#39; and some form of life after death</li>
<li>In some Christianities, Christ will be actually, bodily returning in the future</li>
</ul>

<p>So it&#39;s a &quot;Why&quot; book morally, but it&#39;s also a &quot;How&quot; book, describing at least how things were, are, and will be.</p>

<p>And the Bible itself frequently refers back to the history that it defines for evidence of whatever claims are currently being made. In the most blunt construction:</p>

<p>Prophets were proved to be actually speaking for God based on their ability to make true predictions about WHAT would happen, which gave them the moral authority to make more WHY claims.</p>

<p>And, there are some explicit places where the bible&#39;s historical accuracy is clearly being theologically depended upon:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. <em>(1 Corinthians 15:12-17)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is no historical Jesus, who lived and died in the way described, the Bible is neither a how or a why book.</p>

<p>Even the way in which Jesus&#39;s salvation is defined to work is built on the past. Christ&#39;s sacrifice is defined in terms of the role it plays doing cleanup for Adam.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people. 19 For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous. <em>(Romans 5:18-19)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems, then, that this phrase (like &quot;<a href="/pan/gods_free_pass">God can do whatever he wants!</a>&quot;) is a good way to avoid dealing with evidence that challenges an already held belief.</p></div>
