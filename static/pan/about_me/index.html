<p>So, who am I, and how did I end up deciding to make <a href="/pan/about/">this site?</a></p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>

<p>My name is Joshua Barratt. I&#39;m a technologist by trade and passion -- from a very early age I had clarity that I wanted to use computers in one way or another to sense the world and influence it. In the beginning I was pretty sure that meant giant robots -- (which I actually got to do for a while) -- and I&#39;m currently working on building the internet plumbing to help people get and keep their web footprints online. I write about those things (and many other passions) on my site <a href="http://serialized.net">serialized.net</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very aware of my limitations -- I&#39;m not a Historian, Biologist, Geologist, Archaeologist, Statistician, Mathematician, Theologian, Philosopher, Therapist, or any other -ist than &#39;Technologist&#39; and (technically) Scientist -- (but does the Computer version really count?)</p>

<p>I have spent the majority of my life as a practicing Christian. A few years ago that changed, in a way which no doubt seemed abrupt to many. (I now think the best term for my <em>religious</em> perspective is <a href="/pan/naming_is_hard/">Atheist</a>. (Follow that link if you&#39;d like more color on what the term means to me.)</p>

<p>How did this happen? Short version: I followed the evidence where it led, as honestly and rationally as I was capable of (which is certainly also limited) -- much of that evidence being what&#39;s cataloged on this site. If you&#39;re interested in the personal story attached to that change, read on.  </p>

<h3>The early years</h3>

<h4>Family</h4>

<p>I was raised in a wonderful, loving family. I want to get that really clear and up front. I&#39;m very grateful to have been raised in such a supportive and, generally, healthy place. I know I was (and continue to be) loved as much as any child could hope to be loved by their parents.</p>

<p>My parents emigrated from Australia shortly before I was born in Los Angeles, CA. My Dad was joining an entertainment industry startup -- providing nearly-silent, high quality portable generators. After a few years (and the arrival of my two brothers) we moved up to the Central Coast of California to a 40 acre Llama ranch, which also housed the company&#39;s R&amp;D and retrofitting facility. Things could have been much worse.</p>

<p>My Dad was a polymath. By trade he was trained as an auto mechanic, but bootstrapped himself into being an accomplished Exectutive, Mechanical and Electrical Engineer, Fabricator, Painter -- whatever was needed. He was full of (we can be honest, sometimes annoying) phrases, but they illustrate his ethic really well. &quot;Can&#39;t never did nothing.&quot; -- there&#39;s always a way to figure things out if you apply yourself to them. &quot;If a job is big or small, do it right or not at all&quot;. At his knee I learned logic and troubleshooting as he took phone calls from stressed operators on-set with a machine that wouldn&#39;t start.</p>

<p>My Mom, when I was a child, was a full-on SuperMom, keeping 3 crazy boys fed, clothed, and schooled, while supporting both my Dad&#39;s work -- and our extensive other activities. More on the &#39;other activities&#39; in a second. My Mom remains my hero in many ways -- incredibly supporting and warm and loving, even though I&#39;m clearly disappointing her, she doesn&#39;t let it get in the way. And later in her life she&#39;s wowed my by how capable she&#39;s remained in the face of a lot of heartbreak and adversity; caring for people who need to be cared for, and standing up for herself and others who depend on her.</p>

<h4>Faith</h4>

<p>It&#39;s hard to talk too much about my family without discussing The Family
Religion, as it was woven into every aspect of our family identity -- so I&#39;ll divert to that.</p>

<p>I was raised as a Christadelphian, which is a term that the majority of people
are not familiar with. It&#39;s a Christian sub-sub-sub-sub-sect, a branch of the
Restoration family tree. </p>

<p>Christadelphian beliefs and culture are both interesting and a little unusual.</p>

<p>On the belief side, notable aspects include</p>

<ul>
<li>The idea of the Trinity is a false doctrine. Christ was a literal man and <em>son</em> of God, full of the Holy Spirit, but not identical in personhood to God.</li>
<li>Strong biblical literalism (or at least full, no exceptions, inspiration of the text.) This often leads to a &#39;Young Earth&#39; (the earth and universe are about 6,000 years old, and God-created, of course) viewpoint, which is by far the majority opinion in the group.</li>
<li>Rejection of Hell and the idea a supernatural Devil and/or Satan.</li>
<li>Christ&#39;s return is just around the corner, he&#39;ll return in fire and sword to judge the living and the dead Any Day Now. These are the End Times.</li>
<li>No baptizing babies (or the dead), you &#39;opt-in&#39; to the group by, as an adult (or, really, adolescent+) &#39;interviewing for baptism&#39; -- basically, meeting with the local elders (the &#39;Arranging Board&#39;) to make sure you actually understand the doctrines. Then, you&#39;re fully dunked in water, and welcomed to the group.</li>
<li>The Biblical Patriarchy is very important. &quot;Man is the head of the Woman, Christ is the head of Man.&quot; Women are expected to cover their heads -- if not at all times, at least during &quot;official&quot; worship services.</li>
<li>Because true citizenship belongs to Christ, participating in politics, juries, or the armed services is forbidden. Members are &#39;strangers and pilgrims in the land where the sojourn.&#39;</li>
</ul>

<p>Culturally is another story.</p>

<p>A lot of people (generally, former Christadelphians) use the term &#39;cult&#39; when discussing it. I&#39;m still not sure it&#39;s warranted. It&#39;s very friendly but it&#39;s <strong>very</strong> insular.</p>

<p>The group is highly connected, even while having no centralized control structure. For example, I could generally be assured that with an email or phone call, I could have a family to stay with in almost any city in the world. A lot of this connectivity and trust is probably because of the small-ish overall size of the group, but there are some other factors.</p>

<p>Christadelphians meet in small local groups called &#39;Ecclesias&#39; (you can say &#39;Churches&#39;, but Greeking it up makes it more exclusive). Sometimes these are just based on locality, but often there&#39;s also a cultural component. I attended a more liberal one in the neighborhood (and look where <strong>that</strong> got me) but I could have driven to a few more conservative Ecclesias within 10 miles.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a strong rhetoric about &quot;The World&quot;. Everyone who is not in-group is &quot;The World.&quot; We didn&#39;t have a TV because that would bring &quot;the world&#39;s influence&quot; into our home.</p>

<p>People are referred to as &#39;Brother&#39; and &#39;Sister.&#39; And, yes, people more than a few times have introduced me to their &#39;Sister-Wife.&#39;</p>

<p>Marrying out of the faith is highly stigmatized. People would use phrases like &quot;oh, yeah, he married out of The Truth.&quot; The Truth is a common phrase Christadelphians use about their religion, which, with some distance, seems just a <em>touch</em> hubristic.</p>

<p>The group is very academic, lots of Bibles (and Concordances and other study aids) open regularly. Part of this is because it&#39;s a &quot;lay community&quot; -- no paid ministers or clergy -- all services and teaching are led by the members themselves. Sometimes this leads to people sharing personal stories, but there&#39;s a general trend of pretty bookish talks.</p>

<p>Doctrinal details really tend to matter. In fact, there are many flavors of Christadelphian, split along fairly subtle differences in understanding, who often wouldn&#39;t recognize the validity of another sect&#39;s faith. In North America, the biggest groups are &quot;Amended&quot; and &quot;Unamended&quot;, and since I was a wee child I&#39;ve been on the sidelines of emotional battles to merge them, which sometimes has caused further splitting instead.</p>

<p>You spend a <em>lot</em> of time together and around lay-prepared talks, from Sunday School (with editions for adults and the other various age ranges), to weekly Bible Class, to The Exhortation (which most people would call &#39;a Sermon&#39;), to the less common Sunday Evening event.</p>

<p>Beyond that there&#39;s the larger periodic events; &#39;study weekends&#39; and &#39;fraternals&#39;, which in Southern California means a get together of most folks from Santa Barbara to San Diego, for 1 or 2 days, and an annual &#39;Bible School&#39;. Get away from The World for a week and bond with those who Share The Hope. For those in the vital 13-25ish bracket, there&#39;s frequent opportunities to get together beyond these things; a weekly meetup on Friday nights, and lots of extra &#39;CYC conferences&#39; spread through the year. This frequent meeting at a hormonally explosive time helps a lot with ensuring people get &quot;married into the truth.&quot; Of course, pre-marital sex is strictly forbidden, but marriage is a &#39;Godly vessel for those urges.&#39;</p>

<p>The general vibe is very conservative (if the head covering requirement wasn&#39;t a clue.) Music can vary regionally, but it tends to the &quot;piano/organ, 4 part harmony, if the composer&#39;s not dead, it&#39;s too radical, and if we believed in the Devil, drums and electric guitars would <strong>totally</strong> be his work.&quot; You can probably guess the stance on homosexuality.</p>

<p>The verses about not causing your brother offense inform a lot of decisionmaking and almost certainly inform the slow rate of change in the culture. &quot;Use &#39;multimedia&#39; in your exhortation? I think old Sister Martins would be offended by that, don&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p>To illustrate the power of the culture, I present two data points.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>On my Mom&#39;s side, membership in this group goes back at least 6 generations, and as far as it possibly could. Her great-great-great-...-Aunt married the co-founder. That&#39;s pretty sticky.</p></li>
<li><p>I was recently shocked by what happened when I pulled my Facebook statistics from <a href="http://wolframalpha.com">WolframAlpha</a>. They generated a visualization of your social network, as interconnected.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img alt="Fun times in a Facebook Network" width="465" height="372" src="/pan/images/fun_facebook_networking.jpg" /></p>

<p>This shows that, with very few exceptions, even to this day my social network consists of mostly Christadelphians and people I&#39;ve worked with at my current (10 years now) company. The exception at the bottom is a group of awesome people I met post-deconversion while taking a really great natural childbirth class. I&#39;m not sure I would have made those friendships if I was still in the &quot;they are of the world&quot; mindset.</p>

<p>My family&#39;s version of the culture (which allows for a moderate amount of local variation) was an interesting mix of very, very serious and committed -- and very loving and &quot;principles trump rules.&quot; We generally read the Bible every night, as a family, for about an hour after dinner. (Very often, we had other Christadelphians staying or living with us, and they&#39;d all join in, too.) Many or most nights, my Dad would head upstairs after that to work on one or more of the things I&#39;ve mentioned (sermons, classes, etc) -- or in my Dad&#39;s case, coordinating the mission program he and my Mom ran, or working on one of the week-long Bible schools he often got invited to speak at.</p>

<p>Despite all that, I still have the recollection of getting a decent amount of attention from him. Sadly -- and I still miss him like crazy -- he died while I was in college, doing mission work in Jamaica.</p>

<h4>My Arc</h4>

<p>I was always a skeptical kid. I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to teach me in Sunday School. I remember talking to my brother when I was pretty young, saying &quot;I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m just not chosen.&quot;</p>

<p>Growing up in the 1980&#39;s in a group which expected Armageddon to arrive any minute was pretty strange. Russian nukes, followed by flaming robed guys from heaven, appeared in more than a few of my dreams.</p>

<p>Even then (and it&#39;s still possible for certain kinds of news stories to send a big bolt of primal fear through me, thanks, early programming) I was a reluctant participant. I deeply compartmentalized my religion through my entire life -- many people who have known me for years are shocked that I was ever religious. When it was time for me to go to a youth conference or a Bible School, I would white-lie to school friends that I was &#39;camping with my family&#39;.</p>

<p>Almost all my church friends (most of whom I&#39;ve known since we were infants together) were getting Baptized and joining up -- and though I was starting to take a leadership role in the youth group, and starting to present things -- I wasn&#39;t ready. I headed off to College, still not sure which direction to go. It&#39;s just in writing this that I remember my inner dialog; &quot;in Israel, Levites weren&#39;t called (<em>Num 4:3</em>) to serve until 30! I&#39;ve still got time to sort this out...&quot; </p>

<p>How did I eventually decide to get Baptized myself? I&#39;m not exactly sure, but there&#39;s an uncanny correlation to the first time I fell in love with a VERY devout Canadian Christadelphian Girl, whom I desperately wanted to impress. I eventually managed to, and we had a strange 5ish year on/off/on/off long distance relationship. But even in that, I was experiencing a lot of doubts, which in part led to it&#39;s eventual end.</p>

<p>I think in retrospect that my Dad&#39;s death impacted me really coming to terms with things for a long time. I was still wrestling with my possible unbelief (especially as I chose upper division history classes to get more context about the historical background of my faith) when it happened. All that (as well as working 80 hour weeks at .com startups and trying to graduate) were very effective distractions.</p>

<p>I even married a wonderful woman (at the time, &#39;in the faith&#39; as well; also someone I&#39;ve known from essentially infancy) in a full-on Christadelphian wedding, with around 400 of our &quot;family in Christ&quot; in attendance. And those people did (and in most cases, still do) feel like family.</p>

<p>A few words on my Wife -- though she&#39;s reached very similar conclusions as I have, I&#39;m keeping this personal; if you&#39;d like her take on things, she&#39;s more than open to conversations as well. Though we had different motivators behind originally starting to question our faith, and we searched differing routes, we arrived at the same place.</p>

<p>All disclaimers aside, I&#39;m incredibly grateful that, not only is she awesome in every way -- a fantastic wife, mother, friend, and super perfect for me -- and every day we&#39;ve spent together has been fun -- but that she&#39;s accepted (and in some important ways, been responsible for) this change in our lives.</p>

<h3>The tipping point</h3>

<p>So how do you go about changing your mind about something like this?</p>

<p>A lot of the background about the Church and culture that I provided was to help provide some context in just what a scary, scary choice it was to make. It meant changing the relationship with 99% of the people I was close to. It meant impacting the relationship with my parents, my Wife&#39;s parents, all of our surviving grandparents on both sides, the majority of our aunts, uncles, cousins, all of our brothers, sisters, step brothers and sisters (my Mom remarried) ...</p>

<p>In part because of the effective stigmatization of &quot;the world&quot; (&quot;friendship with The World is emnity with God&quot;, after all <em><a href="http://bible.cc/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a></em>) neither of us had even cultivated strong friendships out of the group. Between us, no lasting friends from any level of our schooling, or prior jobs.</p>

<p>Once, on our 4th anniversary dinner, our conversation tentatively got around to the idea that we might not always be Christadelphian. We both got nauseous. The social cost was almost incalculable. We were so scared, we didn&#39;t even get close to speaking about the topic for well over a year.</p>

<p>A few things happened which kicked our butts into motion. The biggest was having kids. We had a quote on our corkboard -- &quot;the only way to lead a child is to walk that road yourself&quot; -- which made me feel guilty every time I walked past it. We were <em>not</em> walking that road.</p>

<p>My inner doubts had taken my compartmentalization to a whole new level. I could happily construct an exhortation on a Sunday morning which people were moved by, and gave me quite nice feedback on, but something was dead inside. In our marriage we tried to read the Bible together, we tried to pray together, but they were about as successful as any other &quot;resolution&quot;. In an otherwise ideal marriage, we both felt like we were &quot;spiritually letting each other down.&quot; </p>

<p>Even though my son was an infant at the time, I realized that there was no way I would be able to teach my child something which didn&#39;t make sense to me. About this time, my wife started asking awkward questions in Church. At first I was a bit scandalized, but the honesty was pretty refreshing. We both decided to really, actually, take a look at the basis of what, up to then, had been &quot;our faith.&quot; Because, in large part, of the huge social cost of making any kind of change, we really, really, wanted to be able to believe. I kept thinking of the parable of the house built on the rock. Feeling like I was on the quickest of sand, I wanted to dig down and get something firm to stand on.</p>

<p>We started by, on our own, just opening our Bibles and reading -- but asking more questions than we&#39;d previously asked. Dealing with the things which, to that point, had been shoved into the filing cabinet of doubt. </p>

<p>The more we dug, the more detached the way we&#39;d been purporting to believe seemed from reality. It doesn&#39;t take much reading of Genesis (especially up through the flood story) to build a pretty huge list of issues. I was following a reading plan that was built into the Bible app I was using, and it happened to put Job up next. Reading the tale of Job&#39;s whole family getting slaughtered for God to settle a bet with another supernatural entity who I already for sure didn&#39;t believe in was hard. Realizing that the book ends up justifying all that suffering of an innocent man with a sort of 3 chapter version of &quot;Because I am God and I Said So&quot; was worse. And, noticing that the writer though things were made &quot;all better&quot; by just getting Job a lot of shiny new family illustrated some deep, horrible perspective. If someone murdered my sons they would not be &#39;replaceable.&#39;</p>

<p>I moved on to diving deeper into a topic I&#39;d been interested in for years: &quot;how did this book get to us, and who wrote it when?&quot;, learning more about the evidence for the generally accepted contemporary scientific viewpoint, and so on. At every turn we made a good effort to read something on the topic from a Christadelphian or Christian perspective; over and over, even as a layperson the arguments from the theistic camp were either invalid,  dishonest or confused about the real evidence.</p>

<p>Finally, we both reached the point of educational no return. We knew that no matter what, we were at the very least no longer capable of being Christadelphians. (For starters, the evidence that the book we&#39;d grown up calling &#39;The Bible&#39; was absolutely significantly human in nature was overwhelming. This being the foundation that the Christadelphian Statement Of Faith is based on, it was a pretty important difference.) Out of respect for our friends and family who still believed, We stopped participating in the &quot;breaking of bread&quot; -- the most important ceremony -- and I stopped all my lay clergy activity. It took a while to stop attending. It took even longer to &quot;legally&quot; terminate our membership.</p>

<p>The whole change was illuminated by conversation -- speaking about these things with family and friends (and even, in some cases, counselors). I&#39;ve tried to capture the essence of many of those through this site, so the actual process can in part be inferred from these.</p>

<p>When I think about the recipe which allowed our family reaching &quot;escape velocity&quot; -- putting aside the stated beliefs that had bound us to our natural and extended family -- it has a few major ingredients.</p>

<p>One of my close friends had bravely and publicly started grappling with his own phase of doubt. He&#39;s ended up finding a different form of belief, now outside of &quot;The Community&quot;, but his example of breaking what I&#39;d never realized was an extremely powerful taboo against expressing serious, &quot;this might not be true&quot;, belief, opened my mind to the fact that it was actually possible.</p>

<p>At work, I&#39;d recently had to face a lot of relationship and technology mess that I&#39;d been a big part of creating. Over a few days, with some very skilled facilitators, I&#39;d had to be deeply, fully, honest with my co-workers. Honest about things I had no concept I&#39;d even been dishonest about -- things I&#39;d even fooled myself about. I had to face up to a lot of painful personal failure. I even ripped down my compartmentalized world and revealed both the extend of my religiosity, and my paralyzing doubts. And afterwards? The honesty was 100% worth all the pain. I also got a really powerful tool there, the idea of what they called &#39;supplication.&#39; </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve had an epiphany, or some transformative experience, and you go back to a relationship you made with someone prior to that change, there is a level on which that&#39;s not fair. That&#39;s breaking the implicit deal you&#39;d made in the relationship. &quot;You decided to like &#39;this guy&#39;, but now he&#39;s not &#39;this guy&#39;, he&#39;s some slightly different guy.&quot; If you go to people with the mindset that &quot;this is my fault, I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve changed the rules on you&quot; it greatly increases the chances that that relationship will, in some way, survive the encounter.</p>

<p>This is especially hard when the change is around beliefs. &quot;This thing that&#39;s really important to you? No offense, but I think there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;re mistaken. Such a good chance that I&#39;m actually going to radically change my life.&quot; It&#39;s really hard (impossible) for that not to end up being inherently confrontational, no matter what mindset you bring to the table. Starting with supplication was helpful in at least turning the volume down.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very strange thing to sit in your living room and think about people who you love -- who, in some cases, have known you from the &quot;I changed your diapers&quot; stage -- and realize that there might be nothing you can do to preserve that relationship. But that&#39;s what we wanted to do wherever possible -- preserve the relationships.</p>

<h3>Today</h3>

<p>That was a couple years ago, as I write this. </p>

<p>The conversations are still happening. As word of my shocking perspective shift percolates through my extended social network, people pop up in my inbox or life wanting to discuss things. In some ways, I love it. My goal is integrity. If there&#39;s something I haven&#39;t considered, but should, please, bring it to the table. In other ways, it&#39;s getting a little fatiguing. It&#39;s been a while since I wasn&#39;t rehashing a line of reasoning I&#39;d been down a few times, and I think that impatience is starting to leak through my conversations a bit. That&#39;s a part of the reason I made this site. It&#39;s what&#39;s in my head. Start there and let me know if I&#39;m missing anything <em>else</em>.</p>

<p>There are still times when it almost feels like it&#39;d be easier to just go back, like holding out for integrity is some kind of late-breaking teenage rebellion phase. There are days when it&#39;s hard to be isolated, hard to have this dividing wall that&#39;s still wedged in between us and the people we&#39;re closest to in the world. As much as my Mom loves me unconditionally, she&#39;s also able to be honest about the fact that she&#39;s worried I&#39;m actually making a cosmic mistake.</p>

<p>There are days when I&#39;ve felt angry -- angry that I was programmed to have these (what now seem) bizarre beliefs, to be intentionally isolated from everyone not in-group, to have spent so. much. time. of. my. life. reading, writing, presenting about these ideas that now seem so far from worthwhile... but, that feeling fades, too. It&#39;s hard to be angry at nobody. My parents were clearly motivated by love, by doing the best they could for me. Their parents felt the same, their parents felt the same. Getting angry at an abstract idea only hurts the person getting angry. &quot;Hate the meme, love the host.&quot;</p>

<p>But must of the days are good days. For better or worse, there&#39;s a deep simplicity to living the wide open life. After 30 years of hiding parts of myself, ideas, and thoughts -- carefully curating my output as a function of the audience I was in -- honesty is bliss.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>You said you felt disconnected for a long time. Didn&#39;t you just find the evidence that you wanted to confirm your belief that there was probably no God?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s possible, I suppose. As I talked about, I <strong>really</strong> wanted to believe. The reason I was struggling to believe was mostly because even the evidence I was already aware of made it hard to accept the faith&#39;s claims as &quot;true&quot;, and as I explored further, that got worse. I don&#39;t feel dissonant now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aren&#39;t you just letting the mind of the flesh win? The Bible says we&#39;ll be tempted by new ideas, and drawn away by our own lusts...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I talk about this a lot more in <a href="/pan/the_armor_of_faith/">The Armor Of Faith</a>, but those phrases are part of the reason it&#39;s difficult to think critically about these things if you&#39;re raised as a member. Short version, no. Read that link if you want more of the long version.</p></div>
