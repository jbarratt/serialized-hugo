<p>The thing that breaks my heart the most about you abandoning your faith is not what will happen to you, but that, in your <a href="/pan/circular_arrogance/">arrogance</a>, you&#39;re condemning your children as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve gotten a few versions of this sentiment from people and I don&#39;t think they realize just how brutal of a thing it is to say to someone else. Perhaps if I turn it around:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The thing that breaks my heart the most about you raising your kids as Christians is that you&#39;re condemning them to live the one life they have trapped in ignorance, doubt, and needless division from the other wonderful people of the planet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, neither of them are particularly nice things to say, and I only write that as an illustration. There are few things more personal than the way one raises a child, because there are few bigger responsibilities that we have in life.</p>

<p>In fact, it was the depth of responsibility I felt upon starting fatherhood (<a href="/pan/about_me/">more on that</a>) which, in part, catalyzed me to investigate and ultimately reject my ancestral beliefs.</p>

<h3>Zooming out a bit</h3>

<p>What are our responsibilities to our children?</p>

<p>They are legion. We need to feed them correctly, and help them learn to choose right foods for themselves; we need to help them get educated correctly, and help awaken a desire for learning in themselves; we need to get them the right kinds of medical treatment; we need to figure out when and how to get them in bed at night, how to discipline them when they hit a sibling, and react correctly when they come show us the painting they&#39;ve been working on all afternoon.</p>

<p>And, you need to choose how to (or not to) discuss and role model religious behavior with them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that as parents our beliefs (and behaviors) have <em>some</em> influence on our children. <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug00/parents.aspx">Studies</a> put the amount of influence that we generally have at a shockingly low level, but estimates vary. There&#39;s certainly strong evidence that beliefs we acquire early in life quite often stick with us. So, while our children can hold, modify, or reject our beliefs, we have a responsibility to get them on the best foot we are capable of.</p>

<h3>Making choices</h3>

<p>There seem to be a few basic ways people choose a religious path:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be born into it</li>
<li>Marry into it</li>
<li>Start as (1) or (2) but then, due to apathy or instinct, switch to &#39;None&#39;</li>
<li>Do an exhaustive search and choose one (or None) which would not qualify as (1) or (2)</li>
</ol>

<p>Given that there are well over 1,000 major ways people believe (and don&#39;t believe) (and are fervently sure they are right), no matter which route we choose -- if we&#39;re being objective -- we have to admit there is some probability we have chosen wrong. ESPECIALLY if we fall into category (1) or (2), because if there are only one, or a few, &#39;true paths&#39; in those 1,000 ways, what are the odds that we randomly got born into a &#39;right&#39; one? Pretty low.</p>

<p>Even if you fit into (4), as I currently do, discoveries are constantly being made which could (and perhaps should) impact your choices. It would, for example, have been at least somewhat easier to reject the idea of evolution before the genomes started being sequenced and compared. If you decided there wasn&#39;t enough evidence for evolution in 1982, it may no longer be the case. Or, your (4)-choice could have been influenced by a cognitive bias. Any one of these choices still should come with some uncertainty attached.</p>

<p>Having spent a lot of time really chasing integrity and an understanding of my beliefs, it can add to the sting of receiving the opening kind of quote even more when you&#39;re speaking with someone who is &#39;believing the default,&#39; having chosen their birth religion.</p>

<h3>Choices that aren&#39;t</h3>

<p>Another factor that plays into the fallacy of the opening quote is that it&#39;s based on the assumption that we can choose what to believe. We can choose what we <strong>wish we</strong> believed, but we can&#39;t directly choose what we actually <strong>end up</strong> believing.</p>

<p>Assuming I&#39;d taken the doubts I already had and &quot;stuffed them&quot;, just faithfully powered through, what kind of example would that even be setting for my children? Would I be modeling someone transfixed by the joy of their faith? Would I be able to connect with them in an honest and genuine way? It seems unlikely.</p>

<h3>Our approach</h3>

<p>Our approach to parenting is based on two premises:</p>

<ul>
<li>Because what we (as the parents) believe has <em>some</em> influence on our children, we are responsible to them to make the best choice we&#39;re capable of executing with integrity. (Similarly to their nutrition, education, healthcare, etc.)</li>
<li>Because our brains are finite, fallible, and that riddled with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive biases</a>, it&#39;s important to share our ultimate uncertainty about these things with your children.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most people&#39;s version of faith does not allow for this kind of uncertainty.</p>

<p>Faith-ese tends to be absolute.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Son, there is a God and he created this earth about 6,100 years ago in 6 days, as is written down in the book we call the Bible. Every word in there was written by God speaking to people&#39;s minds -- &quot;inspiring them&quot; -- so he could share his perfect truth with us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In contrast, even though my best understanding of this world is that it&#39;s, well, probably all natural, I&#39;d still say something like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Son, we don&#39;t really know how the universe got going, though the evidence tells a lot of the story. There are still exciting discoveries being made. But lots of people have lots of ideas about it... some of the people we love think someone called &quot;God&quot; is the one that made it all. That&#39;s not what Mommy and Daddy think right now, though we used to. It&#39;s always important to be able to look at the evidence and change your mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/pan/embrace_change/">Embracing change</a> is a virtue, and that&#39;s hard to role model when you see that <a href="/pan/faithache/">faith is a virtue</a> instead.</p>

<p>Please note that I am not actually intending to criticize anyone&#39;s parenting. This is an attempt to explain our current mode, and share a bit about how it feels when that&#39;s challenged without evidence.</p></div>
