      <div class='main' role='main'><p>Over the course of my discussions around these topics, one phrase comes up frequently when we find a bit of evidence which is hard to explain. For example, pointing out the complete and utter lack of physical evidence for the Biblical creation or flood stories, or the colossally immoral behavior God frequently engages in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We would call it unfair for God to murder a tremendous number of innocent Egyptian firstborn babies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But God can do whatever he wants!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the <a href="/evolution/flooded_with_problems/">flood story were true</a>, why are there any endemic land animals on islands? Wouldn&#39;t they have all had to travel off the ark?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But God can do whatever he wants!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes it&#39;s followed with &quot;... and how dare you question him.&quot;</p>

<p>As a debate tool, it&#39;s a pretty slick &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card to use. The problem is that the option that God doesn&#39;t exist is always on the table, so all those things that &quot;he can do whatever he wants&quot; are the things that add up to make it much more plausible and probable that he doesn&#39;t exist than that he does.</p>

<p>As worked through in the discussion of <a href="/evolution/flooded_with_problems/">just a few issues with the flood story</a>, you end up having to conclude that, among many other things,</p>

<ul>
<li>God had to relax the laws of physics, because if that much water fell that fast the energy released would have turned the surface of the earth into superheated steam.</li>
<li>God would have had to erase any physical evidence of such a catastrophic event</li>
<li>God would have also had to distribute species all around the world, placing many endemic species on islands, and planting appropriate fossils in the ground beneath them so it appeared they developed there</li>
<li>He would also be fudging all this evidence while also saying he created the rainbow so that people would remember that the flood had happened, thus contradicting the stated purpose.</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s a simple example of the lengths you need to start going to to support the &quot;God can do whatever he wants&quot; premises.</p>

<p>The alternative explanation -- that the story is a myth, and not fact -- is vastly more plausible.</p>

<p>The book of Job is an elaborate version of &#39;God can do anything he wants&#39;. Horrible, horrible things happen to Job and his entire family is brutally murdered, and after a book&#39;s worth of debate, God arrives to explain what&#39;s going on. The big reveal? &quot;I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT.&quot; &quot;I made this place, and I&#39;m much bigger than you, and older than you, and it&#39;s morally wrong to even ask questions of me, because I can do anything I want. You wouldn&#39;t understand.&quot;</p>

<p>As another way to illustrate the futility of this approach, let&#39;s assume we&#39;re having a discussing on the larger questions of God&#39;s existence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God created everything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually, my buddy Stewart created everything, including God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? That makes no sense! Why have I never even heard of Stewart?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stewart likes his privacy. Stewart can do anything he wants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I asked Stewart about this what would he say?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stewart would probably deny it, but that&#39;s no reason to doubt him. Stewart can do anything he wants.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t really lead to a higher level of understanding.</p></div>
