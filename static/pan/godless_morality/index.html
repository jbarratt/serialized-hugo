<p>You don&#39;t believe in God?! How can you be moral, then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s pretty amazing how often this question, or variants on it, come up.</p>

<p>Because in the believer&#39;s frame of reference, morality is God-defined -- that God provides the final check on if something is moral or not, and that he&#39;s communicated those morals to us in the Bible -- it&#39;s understandable where this reaction comes from.</p>

<h3>Historical issues</h3>

<p>However, zooming even slightly out of our own local culture, we can see pretty quickly that this idea makes no sense. What about all the ancient and current cultures not based on Judeo-Christian standards -- are they immoral or amoral? Chinese, Japanese, Greek and Roman cultures immediately stand out as having created very sophisticated moral frameworks. The first known laws -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi">the Code of Hammurabi</a> -- predates any culture that had the Judeo-Christian understanding of God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you&#39;re forgetting that God created everything and has been with humanity since the beginning! God probably shared His morality with humanity first in the Garden, and people have just passed it down and corrupted it in various cultures since then!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully some of the other sections of this site which refer to the total bankruptcy of the Old Testament narrative of how we all got here will serve as my answer to that. There&#39;s no evidence at all that that story is in any way true, and plenty of evidence that it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a simple test: assume for a second that you have irrefutable proof that God does <strong>not</strong> exist. How would you behave? Would you cheat on your spouse? Would you murder the neighbor whose friends always block your driveway when they visit? Would you steal the new iPhone? Hopefully not! Why not?</p>

<ul>
<li>You&#39;d still have some internal sense that those things are wrong.</li>
<li>There would be social consequences for getting caught doing those things.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that in-built sense is almost identical, in weird and specific ways, across all human cultures.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a group of ethical thought experiments, collectively called the &#39;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">Trolley Problem</a>&#39; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Person A can take an action which would benefit many people, but in doing so, person B would be unfairly harmed. Under what circumstances would it be morally just for Person A to violate Person B&#39;s rights in order to benefit the group?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have translated the basic tests into over 100 countries and 200,000 individuals and the results show a remarkable consistency, strong evidence for some shared moral &#39;plumbing&#39; in our brains.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course you have an in-built sense of what&#39;s wrong! God put it there! How else would it get there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because all social animals which cooperate have evolved mechanisms which enable them to cooperate. Dolphins, Birds, Primates of all stripes, all have some form of &quot;morality&quot;. &quot;Here are the things it&#39;s ok to do in our social group.&quot;</p>

<p>Some examples: there&#39;s a famous experiment in which a pair of monkeys in adjacent cages are given cucumbers as a reward for fetching a rock for a researcher. When one is given a grape instead (which the monkey prefers), the other throws the food at the researcher.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-KSryJXDpZo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>&quot;Fairness&quot; is a pretty sophisticated mechanism.</p>

<p>There&#39;s <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/09/bird-brains-crows-remember-your-face-and-know-youre-hiding-in-there/">another example</a> where mask-wearing researchers were working with a group of crows. One mask was for mistreating the crows, the other was for feeding them. They learned who to trust and who not to trust, and this information was socialized to crows even not present. Reputation is another fundamentally important aspect of &#39;group morality&#39;.</p>

<p>So why should these things exist at all?</p>

<p>In general, animals being able to cooperate gives them a survival advantage. </p>

<p>If we consider 4 animals that are identical, except 2 of them can cooperate with each other, those two will be on average more successful than the others. They can take turns sleeping and standing watch. They can hunt together, including doing tricky things like &quot;ambushes.&quot;</p>

<p>A smaller, smarter, cooperative animal is much more resilient than a large, solitary one, too.The population can temporarily shrink and grow in times of scarce resources, and the species lives on. We know humans co-existed with woolly mammoths, but only one of us is still around.</p>

<p>So to pull this off, you need social guidelines. If you&#39;re just randomly killing each other, the species won&#39;t survive. That needs to be &#39;wrong&#39; on some level. So does taking each other&#39;s stuff. These kinds of instincts aren&#39;t just about morality, but also provide the drive that helped create language, explains how we signal to each other things like anger, lust, and other emotions.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory">Evolutionary Game Theory</a> for a more technical analysis and lots of examples of interesting &quot;alternative moralities&quot; in nature.</p>

<h3>Biblical issues</h3>

<p>There&#39;s another problem with this question -- it assumes that the Bible provides some kind of absolute moral guidelines.</p>

<p>However, you don&#39;t have to read very far before it&#39;s obvious that the morality that&#39;s described biblically is not one that would be very well received in our current culture.</p>

<p>The Bible is full of genocides, slavery, un-condemned rape, treating women and children as property, animal cruelty, and many other things we consider horrifying. Many of these things are recorded as having been allowed, ordered, or personally executed by God himself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not seen as a problem that God routinely wipes out seemingly millions of people. The flood reduced the worldwide population to 8. Sodom and Gomorrah burned two major cities worth of people to death.</p>

<p>And even if you are just trying to take examples from things you should do by law, you&#39;ve got some problems. A few examples, only considering those in which people end up beaten to death by rocks:</p>

<ul>
<li>If your children were really disobedient, you should beat them to death with rocks. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+21%3A18-21&version=KJV">Deuteronomy 21:18-21</a></li>
<li>If anyone ever mis-used God&#39;s name (OMG!) they should be beaten to death with rocks. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+24%3A16&version=KJV">Leviticus 24:16</a></li>
<li>For gathering sticks on the sabbath, you should be beaten to death with rocks: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2015:32-36&version=KJV">Numbers 15:32-36</a></li>
<li>For being an engaged urban rape victim who failed to scream loud enough, you should be beaten to death with rocks: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+22%3A23-24&version=KJV">Deuteronomy 22:23-24</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And if you think this kind of strict, on the spot death sentence went away with the coming of Jesus, then what about the story of Ananias and Sapphira (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%205:5-10&version=KJV">Acts 5:5-10</a>) who, upon telling a lie to Peter, are murdered on the spot?</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until I had some distance from belief that I realized how morally disgusting the plagues were. Due to one guy <strong>whose heart God &#39;hardened&#39;</strong>, I repeat, <strong>because of a choice God made</strong>, something like 3 million people were afflicted by all kinds of horrors. Because God was trying to make some kind of point. And for the crowning achievement, God killed all the firstborn children of all the people living there. </p>

<p>Do you have children? How would you feel, living in a country, minding your own business, trying to live a good life, loving your family and your children, and all the sudden the ruler of your country starts acting weirdly, and, after a bunch of horrible stuff happens to your whole family, your precious eldest dies.</p>

<p>If we consider a dictator ordering that all the first-born children of a neighboring nation be killed, it would be the most ghastly war crime of all time. (Ok, maybe #2, the #1 spot is hard to unseat.)</p>

<p>And we are told that God that did this -- again, &quot;punished&quot; someone, and every citizen of their country, for the way <strong>he made</strong> them behave -- and that this is our highest ideal of justice. This is the standard of absolute morality that we are all basing our lives on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God was doing this so the people of Egypt would get his message! The Bible records that some of them were converted! It was actually a very merciful act.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A being that was powerful enough to create the entire universe had no better public relations tools than causing massive undeserved suffering and death? No.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How dare you question God! <a href="/gods_free_pass/">God can do whatever he wants!</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As much as you have to realize that&#39;s not a satisfying response, even if we say &quot;ok, he can!&quot; it doesn&#39;t solve the problem.</p>

<p>In what way, then, does God and the Bible define morality? How is a follower of God supposed to choose to act? Clearly, just emulating God, or even following his laws (get out those sharp rocks!) is not acceptable. </p>

<p>Biblical Morality in practice is &quot;the set of moral principles and instruction laid down in the Bible which correlate to things the current culture also accepts.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have to accept the guidance of the Holy Spirit on this one. If you believed, you&#39;d know what God&#39;s intention is now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For that to be true, we&#39;d expect to see identical conclusions across believers. Even in the same sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sect, that&#39;s not true, let alone the larger divisions (like Islam vs Christianity vs Judaism) which share common texts.</p>

<h3>Wrapping up</h3>

<ul>
<li>There are deep and rich natural reasons for our well-developed senses of morality.</li>
<li>The Bible provides no kind of standard at all for selecting an action as moral or immoral.</li>
