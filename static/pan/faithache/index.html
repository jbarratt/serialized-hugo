<p>faith, noun
1. complete trust or confidence in someone or something: <em>this restores one&#39;s faith in politicians.</em>
2. strong belief in God or in the doctrines of a religion, based on spiritual apprehension rather than proof.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Faith is something baffles me the more I consider it.</p>

<p>In at least the present American culture, it&#39;s considered to be a virtue. It&#39;s hard to get nominated in some political parties unless you profess it. But why?</p>

<p>Faith, as the definition shows, is believing something not supported by evidence, and acting as if it was.</p>

<p>However, this isn&#39;t how we&#39;d want other people to act when it can impact our lives.
If the doctor says &quot;I prayed last night that I&#39;d find the right drug to treat you, and this one was on the desk this morning, it&#39;s a sign&quot;, most of us would say &quot;actually, I&#39;d prefer one which has shown in clinical trials to be effective at treating my disease.&quot; If the mechanic uses faith as the basis for suggesting we need a new engine block, we&#39;d probably ask for some more evidence before writing a check. And if someone who has faith that they&#39;re on a holy mission from God wants to fly an airplane into a building, people get a little upset.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s a real sense in which people want to be able to have faith, but not be faithed-at.</p>

<p>In most of my conversations, people aren&#39;t actually willing to say that they live by pure, simple, blind faith. Usually it goes something like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have Faith in God, but that faith is supported by all of the evidence (historical, biblical, prophetic, and my own feelings.) It may not justify all my conclusions, but it provides enough support that I can safely assume the rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s ok! The problem is that because faith glosses over the evidences, it becomes very hard to actually reason about if they do, in fact, support that conclusion.</p>

<p>For example, in many conversations, people will say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even though I see there might be some challenges in the biblical creation story, because it contains many valid biblical prophecies, I know the whole book must be supernaturally authored, and therefore trustworthy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s great! Which prophecies in particular?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One example is the prophecy of Tyre.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, but that one has some <a href="/pan/the_bible/tyre_prophecy">serious issues</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I believe it because of faith.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So as much as people like to consider that their faith is just a slight extension of things that they have strong evidence for, once that evidence is examined, it often reduces to &quot;I believe what I believe because I choose to believe it.&quot;</p>

<p>This ability for faith to obscure the real credibility of the evidence can get very painful when it comes to making decisions that can impact others. Let us say that your faithful interpretation of the bible tells you that homosexuality is evil, wrong, and rejected by God. How then should you act if your child tells you that this is their sexual orientation? By making it a black and white faith-based decision, you have very little latitude.</p>

<p>However, a more probability-based approach is much more flexible. When we start to consider the probabilities that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Those verses were originally inspired by God and successfully transmitted through the ages to you uncorrupted</li>
<li>That they were translated accurately across language and cultural barriers</li>
<li>That your local religion has correctly interpreted the meaning and consequences of these verses</li>
<li>That you have in fact chosen the right local religion</li>
</ul>

<p>Since all of those probabilities are all less than one, the combined probability that &quot;your child is evil and must be rejected or fixed&quot; might be significantly less than 90%. What if it&#39;s 80%? What if it&#39;s 70%? What if it&#39;s 60%? At what point is it less risky to actually accept them?</p>

<p>Faith doesn&#39;t have this kind of granularity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But everybody has faith. You put faith in evolution!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. I believe that evolution is the best explanation of the facts to which I have been exposed. I welcome new information that would change that hypothesis. There is so much information that I consider it well over 99% probable that it&#39;s the best explanation.</p>

<p>This is fundamentally different than faith.</p></div>
