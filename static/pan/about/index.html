      <div class='main' role='main'><h1>About this site</h1>

<p>I grew up in a very God-believing home and community, and that&#39;s no longer the case. I wrote what is probably too much about that in the <a href="/about_me/">&#39;About Me&#39;</a> page.</p>

<p>After years of study, thought, and conversation, my views have changed quite a lot.</p>

<p>My hope is that this site can provide a bridge for those who, finding themselves in a mindset similar to the one I started in, would like to understand more of the path I&#39;ve taken; would like to understand more about the views I now hold and the reasons I hold them.</p>

<p><img alt="The Bridge" width="561" height="255" src="/images/the_bridge.png" /></p>

<p>I understand there are many people who aren&#39;t interested in crossing the bridge. Even looking at the bridge might be unpleasant. That&#39;s ok, the bridge isn&#39;t for you. This is an opt-in bridge.</p>

<p>Since I came out as an <a href="/naming_is_hard">atheist</a>, I&#39;ve been involved in a lot of conversations (face to face, phone, electronic mail, etc) with friends, family, and the faithful. At this point, many of these conversations are covering ground that I&#39;ve covered at some length in the past; and yet, the conversations keep happening. I&#39;m happy for them to happen; they&#39;re often a sign of love on the part of the converser. But they often require &quot;building the bridge&quot; by hand before we can get to any substantial dialog.</p>

<p>So, one reason for making this site is sheer laziness. I can direct people here, where my evidence and reasoning, as flawed as it certainly is, is on display. &quot;Here is my bridge. I am delighted to have you inspect it.&quot;</p>

<p>The potential that my facts are suspect or reasoning is flawed is another reason to publish all of this. Given the choice to be &#39;correct&#39; or &#39;incorrect&#39;, I&#39;ll choose &#39;correct.&#39; I&#39;ve changed a lot to get here, and I&#39;ll be really disappointed if I don&#39;t get to learn I&#39;ve been wrong about more things in the future. So, it&#39;s a place to trap errors, missing evidence and logical fallacies.</p>

<p>The third big reason is that I&#39;ve been exploring the &#39;big questions&#39; -- how did we get here, where might we be going, what&#39;s the explanation for all this mess -- for a while now, so this is also functioning as a kind of journal of discovery.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>

<p>Because of <a href="/about_me/">my context</a>, much of this site will be addressing two core questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the Bible true? Is it a reliable thing to build a life around?</li>
<li>Outside of the bible, is there any evidence to suggest that a God or Gods exist?</li>
</ul>

<p>At present, I find the answer to both of those to be &#39;very probably not.&#39;</p>

<p>The remainder of the site will be other related, but hopefully more positive, explorations.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>As this site was mostly spawned from discussions I&#39;ve had, it felt most natural to make it discussion-esqe. That&#39;s meant lots of links to other, related articles, where I discuss things, and occasional snippets of imaginary conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You mean like this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s it, exactly. Having spent many years as a believer, I can sometimes anticipate the way (at least I) may have responded to a given point in the past -- and, having had many conversations around these topics, they&#39;re often based on real responses I&#39;ve gotten.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if you didn&#39;t anticipate <em>my</em> question/objection/comment, smartypants?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Awesome, please share it with me! If you know me already, feel free to send an email, otherwise I&#39;m working on a feedback mechanism to provide a bit of a buffer from the complete unfiltered internet.</p>

<h3>Apparent Certainty</h3>

<p>I am not 100% certain about a single word I have written on this site.</p>

<p>However, if what I want to say is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sky is blue today</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It gets a little hard to read if I&#39;m always writing all the qualifiers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because I have a lot of prior evidence that my ability to sense the light wavelengths which correspond to the color blue is accurate and intact, and that I have a lot of prior evidence for blue skies in the past, and a to-date coherent theory about the mechanisms that lead to the sky appearing to be blue in the first place, it&#39;s extremely probable that the sky does appear blue at this moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So be aware that they&#39;re there in my head. If I write something in a certain-y kind of way, that means I find it extremely probable. If I think it&#39;s very probable, or somewhat probable, or somewhat improbable, I&#39;ll usually say something like that.</p>

<h3>What&#39;s with the name?</h3>

<p>As I <a href="/naming_is_hard/">discuss</a> <a href="/probabalistic_parenting/">a</a> <a href="/faithache/">lot</a>, I think probabilities are about the only useful way to try and come to grips with the world. And, as far as I&#39;ve been able to discover, it&#39;s the most probable explanation (of all the theories I&#39;ve yet explored) is that this world, the origins of life, the origins of the universe -- are all natural. Not Supernatural. Not a product of any one of the thousands of versions of God that humanity have believed in over the ages. But, I&#39;m not sure, and I don&#39;t think anyone can be <em>sure</em>.</p>

<p>So, it&#39;s &quot;Probably All Natural.&quot;</p></div>
