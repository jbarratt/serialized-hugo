<p>I heard you call yourself an &#39;Atheist.&#39; How arrogant are you that you are saying there&#39;s absolutely no God?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t like the word Atheist very much, actually, but it comes the closest to describing my point of view. What I don&#39;t like about it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most people think it&#39;s that kind of arrogant, absolute definition. My brain is too small and my life is too short to be that sure about <em>anything</em>. (That&#39;s a big part of why I named the site <a href="/pan/about/">the way I did.</a>)</li>
<li>As a term, it&#39;s been pretty demonized, in part by it&#39;s association with some unpopular political movements of the past few hundred years.</li>
<li>It&#39;s not really a great primary identifier, because it&#39;s not a statement about anything positive, it&#39;s a statement about what one does <em>not</em> believe. I&#39;m generally more interested in what someone&#39;s about than what they&#39;re not about. There are a few alternatives (Atheism+, Secular Humanist, Modern Stoic) that are more positive and I like a lot, but I just spent a lot of time moving past my last label. I&#39;m not excited about using a new one just yet.</li>
<li>There are lots of things I don&#39;t think the existence of is probable -- unicorns, mermaids, wizards, psychics -- but I don&#39;t need a special term to call those out as things I don&#39;t believe in.</li>
</ul>

<p>In words commonly used to answer the question &quot;do you believe in a God&quot;, the most prevalent terms are Atheist, Agnostic, Deist, Theist ... and from there it gets into the specific version of &#39;God&#39; you believe in.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m not a Deist, because I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any evidence for a God, certainly not enough to be sure that one exists.</p>

<p>&#39;Agnostic&#39; is not a good choice, because I generally hear that associated with apathy. &quot;I don&#39;t care about the idea of &#39;God.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>So I&#39;m an Atheist in the sense that I think there&#39;s no compelling evidence for what we commonly think of as &#39;God&#39; -- or anything supernatural. I don&#39;t deny that such a thing might be possible, though!</p>

<p>I was introduced to the idea of  <a href="http://www.possibilian.com">Possibilianism</a>. </p>

<p>While I like (and agree with) a lot of what they say, I don&#39;t really see a need for it. I&#39;m an Atheist who (like most Atheists I speak to) admits that there might be some kind of God, we just have no evidence for it. Many Theists fall into the same category -- being able to admit that there&#39;s a possibility their current understanding is not correct.</p>

<p>Inventing a new word that nobody knows doesn&#39;t really help with the naming issues too much.</p>

<p>I also think &#39;Possibilianism&#39; is baked into the mechanism of science itself. Science is about making the best possible explanation we can from the data on hand. Because, so far, nothing which has initially appeared to be supernatural has turned out to be so -- it&#39;s reasonable to consider natural things the most likely explanation for any data point. </p>

<p>The &#39;Black Swan&#39; is often used as a metaphor to talk about these kinds of issues. If all you&#39;d ever seen were white swans, then it would be reasonable to say &#39;based on the evidence I&#39;ve seen, it is probable that swans are white&#39;. This is much different than saying &quot;swans are white&quot; -- one is a probability based on current evidence, which recognizes that more evidence may be discovered, and therefore impact the probabilities.</p>

<p>So, until the evidence changes my mind, Atheist is the best of a bad set of labels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you saying you&#39;re willing to change your mind?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. I think <a href="/pan/embrace_change/">being able to change</a> is one of the most important skills to develop. It also helps to think about the world more <a href="/pan/faithache/">in terms of probability rather than &#39;Faith&#39;</a>. And, I try and make sure every position I hold to be very probable is <a href="/pan/falsifallability/">falsifiable</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aren&#39;t you worried about salvation? If not you, for your kids? Why not believe just in case?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m shocked by how often I&#39;ve gotten some version of this question. It&#39;s an idea called &quot;Pascal&#39;s Wager&quot;, and it&#39;s very strange. <a href="/pan/no_coin_toss/">I think Pascal&#39;s Wager is a terrible bet.</a> I also really care a lot about my kids, and like my parents before me, I&#39;m trying to give them the best chance I can. <a href="/pan/probabalistic_parenting/">I&#39;m giving them options.</a></p></div>
