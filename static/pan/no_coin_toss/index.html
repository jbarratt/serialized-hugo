<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re taking a huge risk trusting in your own understanding here. Even if you have doubts, why not just believe? Then you don&#39;t put your eternal existence at risk! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This idea has been presented to me a few times. It falls apart very quickly under even very light scrutiny, though.</p>

<p>This idea was most famously proposed by Blaise Pascal, and it&#39;s often called &quot;Pascal&#39;s Wager.&quot;</p>

<p>In his construction</p>

<ul>
<li>We can never be certain about anything</li>
<li>Even if we say there&#39;s a 50/50 chance that God exists, we might as well take that chance</li>
<li>It costs nothing to play</li>
<li>We stand to gain everything if we choose correctly</li>
</ul>

<h3>The problem</h3>

<p>That&#39;s not the world we find ourselves in.</p>

<h4>It&#39;s not a coin toss</h4>

<p>First, It&#39;s a pretty extreme philosophical position to say we have utter uncertainty about everything. There is a lot of evidence which could bear on this decision. (This site being a very tiny collection of such.)</p>

<p>Second, it&#39;s not a binary choice of &quot;believe or don&#39;t believe.&quot; First, one has to select which specific form of belief to hold. We can conservatively say there are at least 1,000 such religions and mindsets that people hold to fervently around the world -- many of which also claim that the other 999 understandings are untrue.</p>

<p>Third, there&#39;s the assumption that one can &quot;choose to believe&quot;, by force of pure will.</p>

<p>Fourth, many religious understandings have an element of predestination, so though we may choose God, there&#39;s some non-zero probability that he/she/it won&#39;t choose us back.</p>

<p>Fifth, many religions have pretty strict definitions of what it means to live a God-acceptable life. So not only do we have to choose correctly, but we have to &quot;live well enough&quot;. Paradoxically, many religions would posit that if you were choosing them selfishly just to ensure your own salvation, you&#39;re already disqualified.</p>

<p>Sixth, many of the &quot;believed true&quot; religions might not be accessible to you due to it being necessary to understand another language or culture to adopt them.</p>

<p>So, being able to choose, choosing, being chosen back, and living acceptably? If one only chooses evidence-free, as Pascal effectively proposes, Shall we call that 1/10,000,000 shot?</p>

<h4>It&#39;s not a free bet</h4>

<p>Finally, most of us would recognize that our lives have some value. Most religions call for some level of time commitment -- service or even just attendance, from the very light &quot;speak Jesus&#39;s name and be saved&quot; to the &quot;Lifetime in a Monastery&quot; level. </p>

<p>Many religions also place restrictions on career paths, lifestyles, sexual and reproductive liberty, and other choices.</p>

<p>There are also financial commitments in many religions.</p>

<p>So, the choice to believe is in no way &quot;free&quot;.</p>

<h4>A very different picture</h4>

<p>So, Pascal would have us picture casually sitting at a dealer&#39;s table for a free toss of a coin, which, if it comes up heads, gives us eternal life.</p>

<p>In reality, we sit down at a table, put a big stack of our lifetime, choices, and earnings down on the table, and say &quot;all in.&quot; Then we write a 7 digit number on a piece of paper and slide it over, hoping that our number matches the one the dealer has under a card.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason lottery tickets cost a dollar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I wasn&#39;t talking about Pascal&#39;s wager, I mean why don&#39;t you choose my religion (or the religion you were born into?) Aren&#39;t you risking a lot (including <a href="/pan/probabalistic_parenting/">your children&#39;s lives</a> by not sticking with your faith?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Possibly, yes. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve spent so much time researching, thinking, discussing, debating -- because it&#39;s a vitally important choice. On the one hand, if I can convince myself to believe in spite of my (well-founded) doubts, AND that ends up being the right choice, because it&#39;s ultimately true, then I will have gained an eternal existence (which, as described, doesn&#39;t actually sound all that appealing.) On the other hand, if either of those isn&#39;t true (and I have a lot of evidence to suggest they are both not true), I will have wasted a large percentage of the only life I have.</p>

<p>So, it&#39;s a big responsibility, but I&#39;m very convinced that at least the <a href="/pan/about_me/">religion I was born into</a> is built on fundamentally flawed premises. Convinced enough to not consider this in any way a &quot;risk.&quot;</p></div>
