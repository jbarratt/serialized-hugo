        <p>How arrogant do you have to be to think you know more about how this world got here than God?
        You think you&#39;re smarter than everyone else who believes.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This can be a hard message to hear. Nobody wants to be told they are prideful, arrogant, or elitist.</p>
        
        <p>I think this response is generally not to be taken on face value. After I&#39;ve asked follow-up questions, it often seems to mean</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>You&#39;ve hurt my feelings by questioning a belief that I find so important I consider it part of my personality. I&#39;ve invested years of my life in it. I&#39;m also hurt that you chose to break the implicit rules and agreements of our community.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>All those reactions are easy to empathize with; they are very human. And being hurtful in this way has been the hardest thing about having to come to grips with unbelief, it was one of the things that made the initial change so <a href="/about_me/">frightening to consider</a>.</p>
        
        <p>To clarify, because it seems to come up a lot: I do <strong>not</strong> think I&#39;m smarter than everyone else. By some combination of genetics, family, and education, I&#39;ve ended up with a very strong bias towards wanting to only hold theories that I can actually validate. Most of what got me to this point was outside my control.</p>
        
        <p>I <strong>have</strong> spent a lot of time -- driven by the aforementioned plumbing -- studying the subject areas which have bearing on the truth or falsehood of the claims of Christianity. However, anyone could do that. And there are millions of subject areas that I haven&#39;t studied, and would be easily out-knowledged in.</p>
        
        <p>So the irony is that these kinds of accusations are coming from someone who&#39;s actually holding an objectively more &quot;arrogant&quot; position. Compare</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>The evidence for the Christian understanding of the world, including the God which created it, doesn&#39;t hold up to scrutiny. I find &#39;the universe is natural in origin&#39; to be the most plausible alternative, but there are many things that in the finite limitations of our humanity, we don&#39;t yet (and may never) know.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>With</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>I am absolutely certain that there is a God, that he created the Universe 6,000 years ago, and that you are doomed because of your unbelief in him. And though many people claim to be Christians, those that don&#39;t share my specific sub-version of the beliefs are doomed as well.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Perhaps you could argue (but it&#39;s a stretch) that they are <strong>equally</strong> arrogant positions to hold, but even then the it&#39;s not nice for the pot be calling the kettle names.</p>
