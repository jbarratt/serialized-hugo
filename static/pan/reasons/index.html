      <div class='main' role='main'><p>I&#39;ve been given several copies of a Christadelphian book (if that word&#39;s not familiar, see <a href="/about_me/">&#39;About Me&#39;</a>) called <a href="http://www.lulu.com/us/en/shop/thomas-e-gaston-ed/reasons/paperback/product-16531421.html">&#39;Reasons&#39;</a>. Along with the most recent copy came a request for some thoughts about the book; this serves as a rolling notepad as I go through it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s billed as a collection of &#39;reasons to believe&#39;. Let&#39;s find out together how reasonable these reasons are.</p>

<h2>The Preface</h2>

<p>The preface starts off with an unusual note.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The objective of this book is to present <strong>reasons</strong> for believing in God, Jesus and the Bible. The book does not respond directly to modern attacks by critics of the Bible and Christian faith, such as the so-called “New Atheists”, but presents positive reasons for belief in the original Christian faith.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems like responding to criticism is exactly what constitutes a &#39;positive reason&#39;. Say a wife suspects her husband of infidelity. If she asks &#39;Where were you the night of the 18th? My friend says she saw you kissing another woman...&quot; the &#39;positive reasons&#39; aren&#39;t very interesting. We&#39;d all like to know the answer to the hard question. If you&#39;re very good at doing the dishes, and write wonderful birthday cards, it doesn&#39;t mean much if you were indeed a bit naughty.</p>

<p>If the &#39;modern attacks&#39; can be defended against, why not do that?</p>

<h2>The Introduction: &#39;Faith in the Modern World&#39;</h2>

<p>The chapter opens with a discussion about the reasons behind the decline in British religiosity of late, in fact, hanging much of the blame on the aforementioned &#39;New Atheists.&#39; After claiming that they are low-quality, poorly reasoning, and &#39;evangelical&#39; atheists, (<em>ad hominem</em> much?)we move to faith.</p>

<h4>Faith</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Faith is a much maligned term in the modern world. Dawkins has chosen to define faith as “blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence”. Though I know of no major religion that defines faith in such way, this conception of faith remains popular. Claims that all religious faith is irrational or delusional are demonstrably false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several problems with this. First, Dawkins&#39;s definition is not that far off from the biblical definitions. Say, Hebrews 11:1. &quot;Now faith is being sure of what we hope for, being convinced of what we do not see.&quot; It&#39;s right there -- trusting (being <em>sure</em>) even without being able to see (empirically verify.) The (uncredited) author of the introduction tries to get around this by noting that the definition of the word &#39;faith&#39; simply means either belief or trust -- but that&#39;s clearly not how it&#39;s used in the biblical context, and in everyday usage today.</p>

<p>Faith must have some differentiation as a concept from &#39;knowledge&#39;. The word is bringing something to the table, and that &#39;something&#39; is a belief without all the evidence that would, rationally, be required. </p>

<p>In addition, one does not need to have too many conversations with, for example, Young Earth Creationists before the exact flavor of faith that Dawkins is referring to is on display. &quot;God said it, I believe it, no evidence will change my mind.&quot; The evidence against that position is so overwhelming that it requires, as he says, belief &#39;in the teeth of <em>(said)</em> evidence.&#39; </p>

<p>(Sometimes, because teeth tend to get fossilized comparatively well, and add much to the fine detail of our knowledge about mammal evolution, it&#39;s literally in the teeth of the <em>teeth</em>. Sorry, couldn&#39;t pass that up.)</p>

<p>Dawkins actually debated Alister McGrath about this, you can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=3LGm0iWPC80#t=199s">watch it</a>. In Alister&#39;s response, he explains that it means exactly this -- that faith is what you need when you get past the edge of evidence. (The whole debate is fascinating, especially since the writer of the introduction suggests that McGrath is a good one to read for debunking Dawkins.)</p>

<p>The author then proceeds to explain how biblical faith is more about in trusting that something will happen than beliefs. This author has not read Hebrews 11 recently, because it explicitly defines &#39;faith&#39; as &#39;belief he exists.&#39; (v6).</p>

<p>He goes on to say that faith is similar to driving over a bridge; we all know there is some probability that it will collapse as we do, but it&#39;s such a remote one, we drive anyway -- and that religious faith is like that. We get enough background evidence that any other solution is improbable, and we go for it.</p>

<p>I&#39;d argue, of course, that if one is honest, there is no such sufficient quantity of evidence to believe, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get into that as the book progresses.</p>

<h4>Faith and Science</h4>

<p>The writer then cites the work of Elaine Ecklund, who has made a career out of whitewashing the atheism and secularism of the science community. I had just read one of <a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/the-evangelical-lutheran-churchs-attempts-to-reconcile-science-and-faith/">Jerry Coyne&#39;s posts</a> about her the day before opening this book, so it was pretty startling to see the name leap off the page. </p>

<p>See <a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/21/rosenhouse-reviews-ecklund/">&#39;Rosenhouse reviews Ecklund&#39;</a> for a breakdown.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As we journey from the personal to the public religious lives of scientists, we will meet the nearly 50 percent of elite scientists like Margaret who are religious in a traditional sense…. (Elaine Ecklund, Science vs Religion, p. 6)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The expression, “religious in a traditional sense” is never precisely defined, but I would have thought that a belief in God is a minimal requirement. With 72% of scientists <em>(ed: according to Ecklund&#39;s own study</em>) explicitly nontheistic, and an additional five percent professing to believe in God only sometimes, it looks to me like 23% would be the <strong>most generous</strong> figure for the fraction of scientists who are traditionally religious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was especially rich to read a citation of Ecklund after Dawkins et al had just been chided for &#39;numerous logical fallacies&#39; in <strong>their</strong> writing. Pot, Kettle, hug it out.</p>

<p>Next, the claim is raised that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is extensive, and growing, medical literature that indicates that religious adherence can contribute to greater mental well-being, better quality of life, higher resilience to pain and illness, and ultimately longer life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That very well may be. The trick will be to try and cut the knot between practices (meditation/prayer/reflection), community, music, and purpose -- all of which can and often are experienced secularly -- from religion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s often been pointed out, too, that we can do many things due to falsehoods which are &#39;good for us&#39;. If we tell a child that unless they are good, Santa will not bring presents, that may improve their behavior, but it&#39;s no argument for the actual existence of Santa Claus.</p>

<p>There is some <a href="http://www.science20.com/rationally_speaking/superstition_pattern_seeking_and_loss_of_personal_control">recent research</a>  which suggests that religion does have stress-reducing properties, in part because it gives us back a sense of control.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whitson and Galinsky put their subjects in a variety of experimentally induced situations where they had different degrees of control, to see how they reacted to a variety of perceptual tests. The results were stunning: people who felt little or no control over a given situation were much more prone to see patterns where there were none, make up superstitious scenarios, and invent conspiracy theories to explain their situation! Why on earth should this be? The authors conclude that inventing patterns is a cognitive way to regain psychological (certainly not real) control over events, thereby reducing stress. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That effect alone could account for the life-extending properties of religion, as the negative effects of stress are well known.</p>

<p>However, just because religion offers this is no reason to keep it, if it&#39;s false. We are complex beings, but the more we understand, the more we can treat ourselves the way we need to be treated to thrive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, however, another way to achieve the same result was to allow individuals to contemplate and affirm their values, after which their proclivities toward conspiracies and non-existing patterns regressed toward those of the control subjects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I&#39;ve discussed elsewhere on this site, religion is certainly not free of stressors. Any time the truth and moral claims of a religion clash with our reality or intuition, it&#39;s painful.</p>

<h4>Why isn&#39;t God obvious?</h4>

<p>This section attempts to address the issue which is generally called &quot;the problem of divine hiddenness.&quot; Why isn&#39;t it easier to see God, or evidence of God?</p>

<p>The answers are split into two channels, &quot;moral&quot; and &quot;philosophical&quot;.</p>

<p>For the philosophical side, C.S. Lewis is quoted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there was a controlling power outside the universe, it could not show itself to us as one of the facts inside the universe – no more than the architect of a house could actually be a wall or staircase or fireplace in that house.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a pretty strange model of God, and one that most people don&#39;t subscribe to. The &#39;cosmic watchmaker&#39; -- a God that just sets things up and walks away. But it&#39;s counter to all of the things people generally believe about God. The comparison breaks immediately. God is said to continue to shape, influence, and work with his creation. One wouldn&#39;t generally expect the architect to pop by and tighten up the faucet or do some weeding, and yet God is in that role of constantly interacting.</p>

<p>The book then moves into the idea that we should not expect to fully understand God, quoting Keith Ward. &quot;When we are dealing with God, it is to be expected that the nature of God far surpasses any possibility of complete comprehension by human minds.&quot; This seems to be an elaborate form of &#39;giving up.&#39; If the point is that we don&#39;t understand enough to know if we can certainly say God does not exist, then we&#39;re on very unsteady footing saying anything positive and declarative about he/she/it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If God is, as theists claim, the cause of all things, the ultimate reality behind everything, then it is not surprising that we cannot begin to fathom the nature of God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But isn&#39;t claiming that God is the ultimate reality behind everything pretty much going far beyond just <em>beginning</em> to &#39;fathom the nature&#39;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet someone may object that, even though God cannot be directly perceived, there are ways in which God could make his existence more obvious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. I do object! Every witness about God (at least the Judeo-Christian God) has tremendous problems. The alleged amazing, improbable events all allegedly happened long ago, in pre-scientific times. The stories are all second, third, 50th hand, full of errors and internal conflicts, and they don&#39;t map onto any of the &#39;truths&#39; we see about the observable world.</p>

<p>Why should I be ok with that? We&#39;re given an analogy of an employer who micro-manages his staff, and we get to see how they misbehave while he&#39;s not looking.</p>

<p>I think this is called a &#39;false dichotomy.&#39; When I say that God has, on reflection, given us <strong>literally no</strong> reliable (by any modern standards of &#39;reliable&#39;, such as would be allowed in a court of law) witnesses to his existence and other truth claims, that&#39;s many miles away from this micromanaging scenario. Why is the evidence for God exactly as good as if he was a human invention, and not a bit better?</p>

<p>And we must be careful not to be too selfish, too, when we consider the hiddenness problem. It&#39;s not just us -- people of our era, our backgrounds, our culture -- that we must think of.</p>

<p>Why would God allow, given a even a very conservative 30,000 year history of humanity, the vast, vast, vast majority of humans that have ever lived to have died without any possibility of &#39;salvation&#39;? Why would God make it so hard to &#39;find him&#39; if one is born in the &#39;wrong&#39; culture, even today? Why are people born in Islamic countries generally Islamic, and so on?</p>

<h4>Introduction Wrapup</h4>

<p>At the conclusion of the introduction, we&#39;ve already gotten into some quite deep water. What&#39;s odd is, counter to the premise in the introduction, most of it <strong>does</strong> seem to be attempting to counter claims of (slandered) atheists. And, at least to me, quite ineffectively. </p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if that trend continues into the body of the book....</p>

<h2>Part One: Reasons For Seeing</h2>

<h3>Chapter One: Philosophical Arguments</h3>

<p>This chapter actually has an author, Thomas Gaston, so I no longer have to act as if I&#39;m writing exegesis of Hebrews.</p>

<p>Right up top, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those who are familiar with the arguments may think that they have long ago been discredited (though this is far from the case.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spoiler alert: I don&#39;t see that this restatement of the classic arguments does much to make that case, as the &#39;old refutations&#39; still seem to hold water just fine. However, as an exercise, I&#39;ll be trying to respond to these claims using everyday language and without a lot of claims to authority.</p>

<h4>The first classic: The cosmological argument</h4>

<ol>
<li>The universe has a beginning</li>
<li>Everything that has a beginning has a cause</li>
<li>The universe has a cause</li>
</ol>

<p>First, to address a side point that Gaston makes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would certainly seem implausible that there should be no uniform causality on the micro level when this is exactly what we find on the macro level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His citation of B. Gordon is fairly suspect; see, e.g. Krauss&#39;s &#39;A Universe From Nothing&#39;, which presents an alternate view. But if you&#39;ve studied either quantum or relativistic phenomena, it is entirely <strong>not</strong> the case that at very very large or very very fast or very very small scales that things work as we find on the macro (or, at least, our experiential) level.</p>

<p>To address the argument itself;</p>

<p>1: It seems like our universe did have a &#39;beginning&#39; in the sense that we&#39;ve expanded out from a very small point. But by &#39;our universe&#39; we mean the &#39;current post-big-bang-configuration&#39;. Where did that hyperdense bit of mass come from? What happened in the moments prior to the big bang, if a word like &#39;moment&#39; has any meaning there?</p>

<p>We have no real evidence to say that the environment which created the big bang (our only frame of reference) itself had any true beginning.</p>

<p>Claim 2 probably does not hold for at least 2 reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Depending on who you read on quantum, it&#39;s probably not true that everything has a cause. In the foam things pop in and out of existence randomly.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if that&#39;s not the case, it&#39;s not logically true that everything that has a beginning has a cause. It&#39;s more properly worded &quot;everything that we&#39;re aware of, and understand the beginnings of, has a cause.&quot; So at best what you get out of that line is a probability, not a boolean true or false.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Even so, (3) seems reasonable, that the universe (our instance of it, at least) has a cause. But, it&#39;s reasonable, not proven.</p>

<p>Ok, sweet. Now comes the making-it-up-as-we-go-along part.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The cause of the universe must also be something prior to the universe so it cannot be any part of the universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why should this hold? Many things have self-referential causes. <strong>I</strong> am tired because <strong>I</strong> chose to write this instead of sleeping. While it&#39;s clear that whatever caused the (this) universe must have had an existence prior to it, this can&#39;t be extended to a claim about the current state of that cause. &quot;The cause of the butterfly must be something prior to the butterfly so it cannot be any part of the butterfly.&quot; Well, the cause of the butterfly is the caterpillar, who is now the butterfly, so he is both prior to and an intrinsic part of the butterfly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When we talk about the universe we mean both space and time; according to physicists both of these came into existence at the Big Bang.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sort of. This universe&#39;s clock and space came into being at the big bang, but that says nothing about other universes, or the pre-universe which birthed our universe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore the cause of the universe must be something outside space (i.e. immaterial) and outside time (i.e. eternal).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I won&#39;t accept a &#39;therefore&#39; there. If our universe was born from a black hole in another universe, or Krauss&#39;s model of foam fluctuations holds, or any number of other possible configurations or extensions to the existing physical knowledge we have are plausible, then the cause could be those things. Not outside time, just before the beginning of <em>this</em> universe. Not outside space, just outside <em>this</em> space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only known things that we know are immaterial and/or eternal are minds or abstract objects (e.g. numbers).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Minds are immaterial and/or eternal? Can I poke around your brain with a knitting needle for a bit? Minds are very material and very finite. Though, that numbers/math line is interesting. I like to think that the universe was created by a hyperintelligent differential equation...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore it is probable that the cause of the universe is an immaterial and eternal mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, since I think you had issues at every link in your chain, I&#39;m taking away your &#39;therefore&#39; license.</p>

<p>Under &#39;Possible Objections&#39;, we get</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why can&#39;t the universe be matter?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... matter came into being at the Big Bang.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>No. The current configuration of the matter in our current universe did. There&#39;s no evidence to suggest there wasn&#39;t matter of some kind, and a remixed version of our current matter, before that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why can&#39;t the cause of the universe be the laws of nature?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... must have causal power ...</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Properly organized matter clearly has causal power, unless one wishes to exist that e.g. every organic molecule on earth is supernaturally fueled.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why can&#39;t the universe just have winked itself into existence?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If things can just appear out of nothing without any cause whatsoever then we have no justification for scientific enquiry or even expecting the world to still be there in the next moment.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This is nonsense. The Big Bang was a special, singular event for our universe. Something like a Kraussian argument for a chaotic emergence does not preclude the idea that in general, things act within normal and consistent probabilistic envelopes. Suggesting that something happened naturally 13.75 Billion years ago does not clash at all with the idea that things that happen every 10 minutes are pretty unsurprising. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What caused God?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only things that have a beginning have a cause. God, by definition, is eternal, and so does not require a cause.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, why not define the &#39;pre-big-bang thing which gave birth to our universe&#39; as being eternal then?</p>

<h5>Summary</h5>

<p>Nobody knows for sure what happened prior to the Big Bang. In terms of what to believe about it, we have two big choices.</p>

<ol>
<li>Nobody knows, let&#39;s see if we can learn more.</li>
<li>I know, and his name is God.</li>
</ol>

<p>In essence, the cosmological argument is saying:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everything has a cause, and that wigs me out about the universe</li>
<li>So I must invent some new being, with entirely new characteristics, that has always existed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why not just say &#39;the universe, in some physical way that we do not yet understand, has probably always existed&#39;? Instead of just slightly extending our current, very workable view of the world, we must add in a radical new actor for which there is no evidence other than our lack of knowledge?</p>

<p>Our lack of understanding of the origins of the universe-before-the-universe is not a reason to believe in God, it&#39;s a reason to fund further research.</p>

<h4>The Ontological Argument</h4>

<p>We&#39;re given a few possible constructions of the Ontological argument, and the most abuse-proof one is:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Premise 1</strong>: The greatest possible being is defined as one that necessarily exists</li>
<li><strong>Premise 2</strong>: It is possible that the greatest possible being exists</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The greatest possible being exists</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Ohhhhhkay. </p>

<p>First, &#39;Greatest&#39; seems pretty subjective. Fattest? Nicest? Most moral? Happiest? How would we score such things?</p>

<p>Secondly, all this argument tells us is that &quot;any ordered set has one or more members with the maximum value.&quot; Yes, I agree. That&#39;s pretty basic logic.</p>

<p>So, according to this model, God is Mohammed Ali.</p>

<p><img alt="ali.jpg" width="300" height="300" src="/images/ali.jpg" /></p>

<p>I kid, I kid. But hey, if it&#39;s subjective, maybe his self-ranking is as good as anyone&#39;s.</p>

<p>But the claim that the greatest being that exists exists and is the greatest being is... simple? And, in fact, Premise 2 isn&#39;t really even useful.</p>

<p>So, it tells us nothing about the existence of the greatest <strong>imaginary</strong> being existing, which is what the original Anselm form was trying to do. &quot;The greatest being we can imagine must exist.&quot;</p>

<p>But David Hume pointed out years (centuries) ago that we can&#39;t cross that divide between things we imagine and things that are. A logical statement like &quot;the largest purple dinosaur I can imagine is larger than the second-largest purple dinosaur I can imagine&quot; is totally valid. However, it tells us nothing about the actual existence of purple dinosaurs.</p>

<p>In fact, the whole point of science is bridging the gap between the things we imagine to be true and the real world. We imagine that gravity might have certain properties, then we get out the telescope and start dropping feathers and rocks under vacuum. But what&#39;s not ok is imagining anything, then inferring anything about actual reality from that.</p>

<p>So, maybe I&#39;m missing something, but I don&#39;t get the ontological argument at all, and especially not the &#39;good&#39; construction presented in this chapter. It avoids the problems of trying to suggest that imagination in some way defines reality, but it gives away too much, by constraining itself to our known reality.</p>

<h4>The Teleological Argument. (or &#39;The Design Argument&#39;)</h4>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Premise 1</strong>: Certain features of the universe appear to be designed</li>
<li><strong>Premise 2</strong>: Things that appear designed are usually the product of a designer</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is a designer of the universe</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, the design argument. How many people weirdly cling to you.</p>

<p>First, there&#39;s a logic error. You forgot to carry the uncertainty from Premise 2 to the conclusion. You can&#39;t say &#39;usually the product&#39;, and then upgrade that to &#39;is a designer&#39;. Gaston, to his credit, admits this. I&#39;m not sure why he doesn&#39;t fix the conclusion to just say &#39;There is probably a designer of the universe&#39;.</p>

<p>And before we get to the presented defenses of the idea, it has a glaring issue.</p>

<p>Much like the cosmological argument, it takes a conclusion (the universe must have had a beginning) and &#39;fixes&#39; it with a new actor (therefore, God began it) which gets the loophole that the new actor doesn&#39;t have the constraint. (... and God is infinite.)</p>

<p>The design argument has the same problem, but even worse, because it&#39;s self-amplifying. &quot;The universe must have a designer because certain features appear to be designed.&quot; However, in every way that &quot;... certain features appear to be designed...&quot; the comparative features of God would appear to be even more (exponentially) designed than that! The argument which points at a designer is one which leads to infinite recursion. </p>

<p>A flower appears to have a designer (God), who, if that logic holds, must have also had a designer (mega-God?) who must have also had a designer (Giga-God?) and so on.</p>

<p>Back to the book, though. The argument presented suggests that we can detect design by finding things that have &#39;specified complexity&#39;. We&#39;re given the example of a specific string of text, such as this chapter, and asked to compare it with something random.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here we have specified complexity and so we can reasonably conclude that this chapter is a product of an intelligence, not chance or necessity. If we can find features of the universe that exhibit specified complexity then we have a strong argument for design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, it&#39;s a strong argument for some other kind of bottom-up complexity generating mechanisms, because of the problem we opened with. (Who specified the complexity that specified the complexity?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Human designers are intelligent and have intentions, so we should be looking for these qualities in our universe-designer. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This line of thinking is probably where much religion came and comes from. There&#39;s nothing which suggests that a human-centric point of view is &#39;portable.&#39; We&#39;re such a tiny spec in this universe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also human designers are something different from the thing they design (architects aren’t houses; engineers aren’t cars, etc.), so we should be looking outside the universe for our universe-designer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, we should be looking in our universe for properties of it which enable emergent complexity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our universe-designer then should be an immaterial, eternal being that is also an intelligence and has intentions. Lastly, if one of the purposes of this universe-designer turns out to be the creation of intelligent human life then it would seem that this universe-designer is interested in human beings. The universe-designer corresponds with our concept of God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This paragraph could be replaced with &#39;our concept of God supports our concept of God.&#39; It&#39;s built on so many faulty or arguable premises and then takes several flying leaps to get to this finish line.</p>

<p>I&#39;m reminded of Kaufmann: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Theology is the finding of dubious reasons for what the theologian has believed all along; and when the chips are down, he consults his conscience and, if necessary, forgets his theology. Sometimes this means a decided improvement. <em>Walter Kaufmann, &quot;Critique of Religion and Philosophy&quot;, p. 152</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h5>Possible Objections</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Given enough time anything that is possible will happen, how can you ever rule out chance?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, as we have seen, the universe is not infinite – it had a beginning in time. Therefore it is possible to calculate the probabilistic resources available and it is possible to rule out chance for very low probability phenomena.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that any &#39;low probability phenomena&#39; have yet to be produced in the work so far as evidence, it&#39;s unclear if we can even make the claim that anything &#39;that improbable&#39; has happened. We must be careful to avoid Douglas Adam&#39;s &#39;puddle problem&#39; (or the Anthropic Principle) when we&#39;re suggesting that anything is actually improbable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, &quot;This is an interesting world I find myself in — an interesting hole I find myself in — fits me rather neatly, doesn&#39;t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next objection:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about multiverse theories? If there are an infinite number of universes then any possible universe exists. You can never rule out chance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chance and number of universes are irrelevant. The &#39;origins of God&#39; problem make the origins of the universe as much of an unknown.</p>

<p>But even so, there are multiverse (effectively infinite) theories, then there are multiple universe theories (countable but still finite numbers of universes.) But we still have to make the effective case that we&#39;re even improbable to need to get into that part of the discussion, which as of yet has not been made in this book.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>None of these arguments would pass muster in everyday scenarios.</p>

<p>If you asked your child &#39;hey, did you do your homework?&#39; you would not accept something like the Ontological Homework Argument (<em>&quot;the greatest possible homework is defined as having all completed-properties...&quot;</em>). We would say &quot;ok, quit stalling, obviously you didn&#39;t do it or you&#39;d just show me.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite telling that these are the first arguments on parade. In a book about the positive reasons to believe in God, these are the best you have?</p>

<p>In the conclusion we&#39;re told that none of these arguments are meant to be standalone; they&#39;re part of a &#39;cumulative case&#39;, which is a popular apologetics approach. But already, what&#39;s been &#39;accumulated&#39; is the idea that some serious stretching is going on. That many &#39;possibles&#39; are being elevated to &#39;probables&#39; and &#39;is&#39;.</p></div>
