<p>Man, how can you put your trust in science? They change their minds all the time! First the dinosaurs had scales, now they have feathers, and Pluto&#39;s not even a planet anymore! And every week butter and coffee flip flop from &#39;will kill you&#39; to &#39;will save your life&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is almost a direct quote, and the general idea has come up quite a few times. </p>

<h3>Flawed Premises</h3>

<p>I think it flows out from the starting belief that the choices on the table are</p>

<ul>
<li>Truth, received from an omniscient and omnipotent God</li>
<li>Changeable, human information from Science</li>
</ul>

<p>Given that I don&#39;t see any evidence for the existence of the alleged God, it&#39;s not really a reasonable comparison. But even if we suppose that (say) &#39;The Bible&#39; was the fully inspired word of God, we still observe a problem in the world. When you look at the vast, vast number of religions which claim that book as &#39;their&#39; holy text, and the wide diversity of beliefs and practices which stem from it, it&#39;s easy to turn the quote around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man, how can you put your faith in the Bible? This church says it&#39;s ok for women to speak, that one says it&#39;s not. This church says God and Jesus are the same, this one says it&#39;s not. This guy says the Bible shows the world ending in 2011, and, well, that didn&#39;t happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it&#39;s a silly response, but it shows the issue -- even assuming (and it&#39;s not a safe assumption) that this book was pure divine inspiration, it&#39;s still being filtered through (demonstrably fallible) humans. We&#39;re all in the boat of having to deal with not quite having access to ultimate truth.</p>

<h3>A subtle kind of &#39;wrong&#39;</h3>

<p>That aside, the examples I often get for when science has been wrong (and is therefore to be considered an untrustworthy enterprise) have turned out to be, generally, a telephone game problem.</p>

<p>Some researchers do a study, in which they find that there is a very slight correlation between coffee drinkers and lifespan. They note cautiously that the results are not conclusive, point to a few factors they think might be additionally responsible, and mention the approach they&#39;d like to take to learn more about their results.</p>

<p>The news the next night: &quot;coming up after the break, what morning staple could cost you your life? Stay tuned to find out.&quot;</p>

<p>Because science is founded on the idea that we don&#39;t know things -- and that we want to gather evidence, propose theories, test those theories, winnow out the incorrect ones, improve the not-totally-correct ones -- it&#39;s an enterprise of probability and uncertainty. It takes a very long time to say anything conclusive. &quot;Yes, smoking will absolutely kill you.&quot; Even then, when pressed, a scientist might be more comfortable saying &quot;Well, we&#39;re 99.999999% positive that, all other things being equal, a smoker will be less healthy than a non-smoker.&quot;</p>

<h3>The Joy Of Being Wrong</h3>

<p>Being wrong can be hard to do. I&#39;ve had a lot of experience. Especially if you&#39;ve been really dogmatic about something, especially if you&#39;ve invested a lot of your life in what you now see is a misinformed direction is humbling and painful.</p>

<p>But the thing is, we are all bound to be wrong, almost always, about something. Time is finite. Our minds are finite. Crack open Wikipedia sometime and be daunted by just all the things that are already known that you&#39;ll never have time to know. Flip over to the discussion page behind any Wikipedia page to realize how hard it is to establish the &#39;facts&#39; of <em>anything</em>. Then consider all the things that we have yet to find out about, discover, solve. We are all wrong, all the time, and it&#39;s a gift when we discover an instance of it, because it means we&#39;re just that little bit less wrong the next day.</p></div>
