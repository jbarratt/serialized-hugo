<p>You&#39;re putting your faith in science and it has a well known atheistic bias. People have to toe the party line about Evolution, you can get thrown out for questioning it.</p>

<p>Scientists don&#39;t want to believe in God so they find what they want to find.</p>

<p>The funding process ruins science&#39;s objectivity, people just find results to get them more grants, and the people who write the checks are biased.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are just a few of the objections that have been raised in my discussions about the subjects covered on this site.</p>

<p>They all fall into the category of &quot;ad hominem&quot; TODO: When you can&#39;t actually address someone&#39;s ideas, attack them personally (or their institution) instead.</p>

<h3>Isn&#39;t it ironic</h3>

<p>Science, as a set of ideas and practices, is actually constructed specifically to counteract as many human and cognitive biases as possible. It&#39;s alone in this, as far as I&#39;ve been able to discover.</p>

<p>So many of the practices which are used (peer review, double blind studies, the use of standard statistical measures to show effects are significant, and so on) are there entirely because it&#39;s well known how easy it is to be biased.</p>

<p>So, while science, like every human endeavor, can still be bitten by biases -- especially when money is involved -- of all the available ways of looking at the world, it has by far the best track record.</p>

<p>Speaking of money -- there seems to be plenty of it out there for someone who wanted to do serious science which supported, say, the falsehood of evolution. The Templeton Foundation (TODO) spends millions on supporting this kind of work. At least in the United States, the amount of political power and spending that&#39;s wielded by the &#39;Religious Right&#39; also makes this a hard claim to hold to. Consider the investment made in combating the legalization of gay marriage; if it was just a question of funding, wouldn&#39;t the Christian Agenda be better promoted by putting some conclusive nails in the coffin of Darwin?</p>

<p>It&#39;s also not true that science is trapped by &#39;orthodoxy&#39; -- there are no sacred cows that cannot be challenged. Recently, there was a very excited announcement that the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/9100009/Scientists-did-not-break-speed-of-light-it-was-a-faulty-wire.html">speed of light might have been exceeded</a>, but it was eventually shown to be a flawed experiment. The important note is that the claims were met with (turns out, warranted) skepticism, but they were still made. The culture of science is not about &quot;don&#39;t step out of line&quot;, it&#39;s about &quot;question everything, challenge everything.&quot; In fact, many of the most notable discoveries of the last 300 years have been exactly this kind of revision of what was commonly held up to that point. It&#39;s not just allowed, it&#39;s expected and encouraged.</p>

<h3>Moving Past Motive</h3>

<p>The great thing about living in http://2012 and beyond is that we don&#39;t need to talk about motive, biases, funding -- we can look at the data ourselves. </p>

<p>There is so much evidence that confirms the basics of evolution and the ancient origins of our universe and planet (and much evidence linking those timelines together) that faking it all would require a massive, hundreds of years old conspiracy. And when we look at the evidence itself, if evolution is not the explanation for it, it still needs a <a href="/evolution/dead_body_problem">better explanation</a> if we are to move past it.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not as if we need to get too terribly sophisticated to start seeing major, irreconcilable problems in the most commonly held interpretations of the Bible; a <a href="/evolution/flooded_with_problems">trip to the zoo</a> will do it.</p></div>
