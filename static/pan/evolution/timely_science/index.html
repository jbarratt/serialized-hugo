<p>Science only works when you can do experiments and reproduce things. Science should have nothing to say about how evolution happened, because it can&#39;t be reproduced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the people who front this theory (and there have been several) are picturing a lab-coated, begoggled man pouring a beaker into a flask and saying &quot;Ah ha! It turned purple just like last time! I&#39;m doing <strong>science</strong>!&quot; Yes, experimentation is a big part of it, but &quot;reproducibility&quot; in that specific, limited way is not.</p>

<p>Informally, the basic process of science is</p>

<ol>
<li>Have a question</li>
<li>Gather information that might help you answer that question</li>
<li>Come up with a theory or hypothesis or model which explains that data</li>
<li>Make some predictions based on that data and test them in a <a href="/evolution/biased_science/">bias-resistant way</a>.</li>
<li>If predictions are false, go back to 3 and get a better idea. If they are in accordance with your theory, potentially go back to 4 until you have more confidence in your results.</li>
<li>Publish your results for peer review. Depending on feedback, potentially go back to any of steps 1-5.</li>
</ol>

<p>The only thing in there which is time sensitive is being able to make and test predictions, which we do about events in the past all the time.</p>

<p>If I come home to see my front door swinging open, my first prediction might be that I&#39;ve been burgled. But, carefully walking in the door, I might immediately notice the TV is still where I left it. More valuables are all found to be in their proper places. I might then go back to (3) and propose  an alternative hypothesis -- that the wind blew it open. Checking the back yard, I see the trash cans are on their sides and a lot of leaves are on the lawn that were not there before. At that point I might feel comfortable accepting that hypothesis as the most probable and moving on. </p>

<p>Or, I might want to gather more evidence and take my baseball bat along for an intruder search under all the beds and in the closets.</p>

<p>Much the same thing can be done for all kinds of things in the past. For example, the &#39;Big Bang&#39; proposes a model which would have lots of implications on the present physical universe. Based on an idea, theory, hypothesis, model about what happened boggling long ago, predictions can be made about what we might see in today&#39;s observable universe to test them. According to the theory, the universe should be expanding. According to the theory, there should be an &#39;edge&#39; to the universe, and it should look a certain way. Great, how can we test those things? Oh, they are that way? That makes that theory more probable.</p>

<p>The same is true for evolution. Given a 20 million year old fossil of this type discovered here, and a 30 million of what appears to be an ancestor here, we would expect to see an intermediate form somewhere in the land which was between them at the time. (This kind of thing happens quite a bit, <a href="/evolution/flooded_with_problems">one example here</a>.) We would expect to see common markers in genomes of supposedly related species. We would expect to see related fossils under the ranges of modern, geographically isolated species, and so on. All these predictions can be and have been tested.</p>

<p>Additionally, while the billions of years long process of evolution cannot be &quot;reproduced&quot; in our lifetimes, it&#39;s not to say we can&#39;t see the process in action. I discuss a few of those in <a href="/evolution/micro_macro_muckro/">Micro- vs Macro-</a>.</p>

<p>The alternative is not true for the biblical story. The bible makes some very strong claims about events that happened at certain points in the past, many of which would leave some kind of evidence around today. For example, if our theory is that &quot;4200 years ago the earth was covered in 14,000 feet of water, causing the extinction of all but a small set of land-dwelling species&quot;, we can make some predictions about how things would look -- and things don&#39;t look that way at all. It&#39;s in fact a lot of this kind of &#39;science&#39; that informs the section on <a href="/the_bible/">The Bible</a>.</p></div>
