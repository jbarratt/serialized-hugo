<p>Natural selection just means that that traits can be &#39;selected&#39; from the things the species is already capable of. So you can select a dog that&#39;s just a little bit taller, or has longer hair, or has a better nose -- but you can&#39;t &#39;select&#39; something that&#39;s not already there, like wings or gills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure this is just a problem of definition. I&#39;d love to see where the theory of evolution is actually defined this way, if someone can point me at the relevant section in any published literature.</p>

<p>The Darwinian use of &#39;selection&#39; is about which organisms, based on their <a href="/evolution/survivial_of_the_most_selfish">fitness</a>, end up actually breeding and passing on their genetic material. It&#39;s &quot;selecting which ones breed&quot;, not &quot;selecting which traits from the original organism are carried on.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that <strong>individuals</strong> having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of <strong>surviving and of procreating</strong> their kind? On the other hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. (<em>The Origin of the Species, Charles Darwin</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know just looking around any family that any two people can have a lot of variability in their offspring, and that any population of interbreeding animals will have even more variation. If food is scarce, the little ones may have slightly higher probability of actually breeding (e.g. the blue circled creatures) and, over time, their &quot;little guy&quot; genes will become a larger percentage of the overall population.</p>

<p><img alt="Selection, as pictured by a child" width="533" height="325" src="/images/selection_blobs.png" /></p>

<p>If there&#39;s some food source available that you can better take advantage of by being big (tall trees, similarly sized animals that could be used for prey, etc) then being big might be an advantage, and then your organism&#39;s gene pool will skew the other way. (And, of course, &#39;food&#39; is just one of the many variables that might impact selection.)</p>

<p>More on how this works, and evidence for it actually happening, see:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/evolution/micro_macro_muckro/">Micro vs Macro-evolution</a></li>
<li><a href="/evolution/creating_information/">Creating Information</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And, again, I need to include this caveat:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You quoted Darwin. Do you just follow him like a sheep now, he&#39;s your new God?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. I don&#39;t follow Darwin like a sheep, in fact, as impressive as his work was at the time, he was wrong about more than a few of the details. The only reason I brought him up is because when the phrase &#39;Natural Selection&#39; is said to &quot;by definition&quot; mean something, it&#39;s good to check with the person who applied the phrase to evolution and see what they meant.</p></div>
