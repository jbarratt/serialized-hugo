<p>It&#39;s very hard to hold out the claim that no evolution of any kind happens. We have too many examples of that happening in our everyday experience.</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyone understands &#39;artificial selection&#39; because of what can be done with breeding dogs, plants, etc.</li>
<li>The problems with antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria have been well publicized; with antibiotics destroying a majority of the population of a given bacteria, only the ones that have mutated to be resistant end up surviving and reproducing.</li>
<li>There are many other examples:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ncse.com/cej/5/2/new-proteins-without-gods-help">Nylon-eating bacteria</a>, (as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nylon-eating_bacteria_and_creationism">contraversial</a> as that claim has been.)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14094-bacteria-make-major-evolutionary-shift-in-the-lab.html">Bacteria in the lab</a> that adapted to metabolize citrate.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s been a while since someone refused to admit that this kind of change is possible in a discussion. However, it&#39;s often given the name &quot;micro-evolution&quot;, or &quot;adaptation&quot;, and people claim it&#39;s part of God&#39;s wonderful design that his creation can change in accordance with changing environments.</p>

<p>However, many people also claim that no new <strong>species</strong> can arise through these mechanisms (so-called Macro-Evolution).</p>

<p>It&#39;s not totally clear where people get this idea. Perhaps it&#39;s some or all of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Many people extract a lot of theory from a little verse. Gen 1:11 says: &quot;And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his <strong>kind</strong>, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.&quot; This is often taken to mean that &quot;kind&quot; == &quot;species&quot;. Dog is a clear &quot;kind&quot;, so it&#39;s ok for dogs to &#39;beget&#39; dogs. However, this is taken to mean that a &#39;dog&#39; will never beget a &#39;non-dog&#39;. Since evolution produces that, over geologic time, a dog can gradually become a non-dog, it contradicts Genesis.</li>
<li>We&#39;re not used to thinking on time scales of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, hundreds of millions, and billions of years. We see the rate of change on a short time scale and intuitively it doesn&#39;t wash that such dramatic changes can take place.</li>
<li>Accepting it means accepting evolution, which has theological implications that people don&#39;t want to deal with.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if you accept that change can happen in a species at all, if you add in two factors -- time and semi-isolated environments -- it&#39;s just an extension of the same &quot;micro-evolution&quot; that people seem so willing to accept.</p>

<h3>What&#39;s a species?</h3>

<p>A &#39;species&#39; is a group of organisms that can breed with each other.</p>

<p>If we picture the group as follows, here&#39;s a diagram of a group undergoing a change. (Perhaps a bacterial strain having most of it&#39;s non-resistant members killed off, and only the resistant members reproducing.)</p>

<p><img alt="Basic changes in species" width="216" height="98" src="/images/simple_transition.png" /></p>

<h3>Add in isolation</h3>

<p>There are thousands of ways that species could end up in separate groups.</p>

<ul>
<li>A forest fire</li>
<li>A glacier or land bridge forming or melting</li>
<li>An earthquake or volcano</li>
<li>A bird dropping seeds or parasites</li>
<li>a flock getting scattered due to a storm</li>
<li>A flock getting scattered post-predator</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#39;s imagine a group of bunnies that end up in separate valleys when they all run away from a forest fire.</p>

<p>Each of those groups would continue to breed, and continue to have &quot;micro-evolution&quot; happen to them. But, since they&#39;re now isolated, they&#39;ll be micro-evolving differently.</p>

<p><img alt="Change in parallel tracks" width="590" height="265" src="/images/after_the_incident.png" /></p>

<p>Perhaps one valley gets more sun, and a certain kind of plentiful but very tough food plant is there. The bunnies with stronger teeth and jaws might do well, leading to this trait slowly being <a href="/evolution/what_is_selected/">selected for</a> over time.</p>

<p>Another valley might have the right conditions for a certain kind of hawk to thrive, and bunnies with better hearing and reflexes live longer and reproduce more, so those traits are selected for.</p>

<p>The third valley might have lots of open sandy rocky area, and not much cover, so sandy-looking bunnies have lower odds of getting eaten, and their color scheme shifts this way over time.</p>

<p>For the first 10, 100, perhaps even 100,000 years, we would expect all these bunnies, should they wander over their nearest hilltop, to be able to inter-breed. (This actually appears to be one of the ways evolution is sped up, when individual populations develop specific traits, which are later brought together via a later reconnection of the sub-groups.) Humans are a good example of this; though it&#39;s often visually clear which sub-group of the human species someone came from based on their appearance, we can generally still inter-breed.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a middle-stage where you might be able to breed, but not actually produce fertile offspring, such as when a Donkey and a Horse produce a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule">Mule</a>.</p>

<h3>Birth of a Species</h3>

<p>However, eventually, these small changes get large enough that they can no longer breed -- and this is the official beginning of a new species. It&#39;s often a very blurry line.</p>

<p><img alt="Change in parallel tracks" width="590" height="265" src="/images/breeding_possibilities.png" /></p>

<p>If this kind of &#39;rabbit goes over the hill&#39; thing happens occasionally, it makes sense that the &#39;A&#39; group and the &#39;B&#39; group might be able to inter-breed for longer than, the &#39;A&#39; group and the &#39;C&#39; group. And, this is in fact common in nature. These kinds of species are called &#39;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species">Ring Species</a>&#39;. </p>

<p>The existence of such species is evolution in action, and means we can consider populations that aren&#39;t &#39;isolated&#39; in such extreme ways as we originally speculated about -- but also those that are just spread over ranges much larger than a given organism would travel.</p>

<p>I used rabbits for this example because they are oft-cited, even by high-profile creationists. Alaskan rabbits can breed with Minnesota rabbits, and so can Florida rabbits, but Alaska rabbits cannot breed with Minnesota rabbits. TODO pictures and links</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But those Rabbits are all still rabbits! Even if some of them can still inter-breed they&#39;re still &quot;after their kind.&quot; Show me more examples of species changing into another species! And I mean big changes, not just &quot;they can&#39;t breed any more.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with wanting to see this in action is that it doesn&#39;t happen in &#39;big changes&#39; ways on timescales that we can &#39;see in action&#39;. Thinking again about human races, many of the differences go back thousands and tens of thousands of years (or longer.) And yet, we can happily interbreed, and remain the same species. On a 4.5 Billion year old planet, this is an instant of time. </p>

<p>That&#39;s another reason many of the examples of truly novel behavior come from bacteria and the like, because they reproduce so rapidly and have such a condensed &#39;codebase&#39;, they can demonstrate evolution happening in our puny lifetimes.</p>

<p>So if we want to see examples of a species really turning into another species we&#39;d need the kind of evidence that&#39;s on those much longer time scales, which means that the whole body of evidence for evolution comes into play. As I&#39;ve mentioned before, a good catalog of such information can be found in &quot;Why Evolution is True&quot;:</p>

<p>My only intention with this brief page was to demonstrate that, if you accept micro-evolution at all, given enough time, you&#39;re accepting macro-evolution as well.</p></div>
