<p>Survival of the fittest is an obviously flawed idea. If that was true, I&#39;d be running around killing everyone so I could survive!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good example of a <a href="/pan/straw_men/">straw man</a> argument; &quot;disproving&quot; a theory by applying one&#39;s own definition of what that theory means.</p>

<p>This idea seems to be a definition problem. There are several basic meanings of &#39;fit&#39;, and it sounds like we&#39;re talking &#39;Schwarzenegger fitness&#39; here -- the biggest, strongest, bulkiest, healthiest will survive. </p>

<p>The definition of &#39;fit&#39; that was actually intended by Darwin was (according to Origin of The Species): &quot;better adapted for immediate, local environment.&quot; So, we might rephrase the intention it as &quot;survival of the best adapted for the immediate, local environment.&quot; This kind of meaning is common in Statistics and Mathematics. &quot;What function is the best fit for the data.&quot;</p>

<p>So, there are scenarios where the Darwin-fittest would be the Schwarzenegger-fittest -- perhaps the biggest, baddest male Silverback Gorilla gets to lead the troop, and brute force does rule the day.</p>

<p>But, there are many other (maybe even most?) areas where Darwin-fitness has nothing to do with strength. A frog whose jump reflex is little bit faster can get out of the way of more trucks. A fish which is a little bit smaller can squeeze into more secluded areas in the coral to feed.</p>

<p>Quite often, &#39;fittest&#39; seems to mean &#39;most cooperative.&#39; Ants are among the most successful species around, if we consider number and mass of them to be a good measure of success. This is almost entirely due to the way they work as a community. A single ant is an insignificant thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wait, are you saying sometimes evolution would make a species get smaller or simpler? The theory of evolution states all species get more complex and larger over time!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This idea has come up in two separate conversations, and I&#39;m not sure where it comes from. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s explicitly stated in Darwin&#39;s Origin, at the very least.</p>

<p>But no, Evolution does not require species to get more complex or larger over time. It only states that &#39;fitness&#39;, as defined above, will be selected for.</p>

<p>So if we assume life&#39;s going along just fine and then BOOM, a massive volcano goes off, clouding the sun for years, lowering the temperature and making food scarce -- then large, complex animals could die off, perhaps going extinct, while smaller/simpler/more fuel efficient animals would at least survive, possibly even thrive.</p>

<p>The general trend we can see played out over the epochs is for more complex mechanisms to be adapted, but there&#39;s no law that says things only work that way. In fact, during times of mass extinction (like what seems to have happened with the dinosaurs), a lot of the most complex species died off, causing a temporary reversal of the trend.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You quoted Darwin. Do you just follow him like a sheep now, he&#39;s your new God?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish I was making this response up but it&#39;s for realsies. </p>

<p>No. I don&#39;t follow Darwin like a sheep, in fact, as impressive as his work was at the time, he was wrong about more than a few of the details. The only reason I brought him up is because when the phrase &#39;Survival of the Fittest&#39; is called &#39;obviously a flawed theory&#39;, it&#39;s good to check with the person who applied the phrase to evolution and see what they meant.</p></div>
