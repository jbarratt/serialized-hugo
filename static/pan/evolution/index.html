<p>Addressing the question of &quot;does the bible tell an accurate story of how we got here&quot;, there are three basic approaches I&#39;ve been on the receiving end of.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="/pan/why_not_how/">The bible is meant to be a &quot;why&quot; book, not a &quot;how&quot; book.</a> The evidence we see around us doesn&#39;t matter.</li>
<li>Evolution is invalid, and does not disagree with the biblical record, because it is false.</li>
<li>A <a href="/pan/evolution/trouble_with_hybrids">hybrid model</a>, in which evolution is allowed to have happened, and somehow Genesis is to be understood as a metaphor or parable.</li>
</ol>

<p>Option (2) seems to be the most popular.</p>

<h3>A plea for a moment of self-honesty</h3>

<p>If you are reading this and believe evolution is false, please take a good hard look at what your motives were when you went and explored the topic. Did you <strong>really want to understand evolution?</strong> Or did you want to feel like, <strong>though your beliefs conflict with evolution, that you could comfortably continue holding them?</strong></p>

<p>I talk more about this: <a href="/pan/evolution/wanting_to_understand/">How much do you <strong>really</strong> want to understand?</a></p>

<p>The best book I&#39;ve found so far for getting a good introduction to Evolution, and the mountains of evidence for it, is &quot;Why Evolution is True&quot;. If you haven&#39;t read it, please open your mind and check it out. Even if you don&#39;t accept it&#39;s conclusions, it will at least help you be more informed about what it is you may disagree with.</p>

<h3>Against my better judgement</h3>

<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t think trying to disprove evolution is <a href="/pan/evolution/right_question/">the right place to start</a>.</li>
<li>I also prefer not to discuss the topic with people who have only studied it enough to be <a href="/pan/evolution/wanting_to_understand">able to prove</a> a <a href="/pan/straw_men/">straw man</a> version of it wrong.</li>
<li>I&#39;m also not the best person to learn about it from, because I&#39;m a curious amateur. Please read an actual expert-written, non-Christian book on the topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>... but, it comes up so often that I do want to address some of the common issues that are raised. This will be by no means a comprehensive proof of evolution.</p>

<h3>Some common objections</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t believe in Evolution because of (<em>some technical reason, perhaps based on mutation rates or information theory</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the time this has been raised, it doesn&#39;t come with a better explanation for the mountains of evidence we&#39;re surrounded by for evolution. I talk about this a bit more in the <a href="/pan/evolution/dead_body_problem">Dead Body Problem</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Science has a well-known secular bias. You can&#39;t pay attention to anything they say, they&#39;re just promoting an atheistic agenda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I were feeling flip, I&#39;d suggest an alternative explanation, which is that science has a well-known <em>reality</em> bias, but it&#39;s a common enough objection that it deserves a <a href="/pan/evolution/biased_science/">more considered response</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Science only works when you can do experiments and reproduce things. Science should have nothing to say about how evolution happened, because it can&#39;t be reproduced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another suprisingly common assertion, which I address in <a href="/pan/evolution/timely_science/">Timely Science.</a></p>
