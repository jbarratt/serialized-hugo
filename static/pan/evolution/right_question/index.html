        <p>In many of the conversations I&#39;ve had around biblical belief, some form of a claim about the untruth of Evolution has been common. And, I&#39;ve often gone down the rabbit hole of discussing them. However, it&#39;s not generally clear what the person is trying to achieve by &#39;disproving Evolution.&#39;</p>
        
        <p>Well, it&#39;s fairly clear. Evolution is often a problem for those holding the Bible to be the wholly inspired word of God because</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>It doesn&#39;t match the Genesis stories of Creation, the &quot;fall of man&quot;, and the flood.</li>
        <li>In providing a compelling, but natural, story of the development of life, it takes many of the reasons one would need a &#39;God&#39; to exist off the table.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If we&#39;re starting from scratch, though, and observing the world around us in an objective way, there are many other reasons that the Bible is not a good explanation of what we see. (Including all the rest of the content of this site.) Assuming we investigated and found the theory of evolution to be totally false, it would still not be a vote for the alternative truth of the biblical version of events.</p>
        
        <p>Then, making things muddier, as we proceed to discuss the merits of the evolutionary model there are two threads which often get entwined:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>What is the evidence for what has happened, historically (What species lived when, what evidence do we have for them, etc.)</li>
        <li>What mechanism powered what happened? (What theory explains how those processes actually worked and continue to work?)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Consider the pyramids. </p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>It&#39;s very clear they exist and that they were built during the time of ancient Egypt</li>
        <li>It&#39;s still not entirely clear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_pyramid_construction_techniques">how they were built</a>, with many competing theories, including that the stones were cast from a form of concrete.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Many people who discount evolution in the discussions I&#39;ve had don&#39;t separate the two. They find an issue with one part of the theory that explains the <em>mechanism</em>, as they understand it, and that leads them to discount the entire thing. </p>
        
        <p>Gravity is similar. It&#39;d be hard to deny that gravity exists, and, in our experiences, follows certain laws. However, the mechanisms by which it works are still largely mysterious.</p>
        
        <p>So, there is a massive mountain of data out there which suggests something -- if not exactly evolution, something with a similar process, over a similar timeline -- <strong>did</strong> happen.</p>
        
        <p>As I discuss in <a href="/pan/evolution/flooded_with_problems">Flooded With Problems</a>, even a basic thought experiment, only considering the facts that anyone can easily confirm, suggests the biblical narrative is way off. (And, being way off causes serious theological issues.) The picture gets far worse when we actually consider the mounting volumes of evidence available to us (especially after the sequencing of the genome.) </p>
        
        <p>Common objections have included:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>The mutation rate is not high enough to generate the amount of change Evolution requires.</li>
        <li>Evolution is not capable of creating new information</li>
        <li>Micro-evolution (change-within species) is common, but there is no evidence for Macro-evolution (one species becoming another.)</li>
        <li>You can&#39;t use science to discuss things which happened in the past, since you can&#39;t do experiments on them</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>All of these complaints can be addressed, but they also lack an alternative, better, suggestion for the evidence that&#39;s all around us.</p>
