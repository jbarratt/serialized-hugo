</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I had 3 discussions where this idea came up in a single month, so it seems worth addressing as a standalone.</p>

<p>Assume you&#39;re a detective responding to a 911 call. You enter the room, and a dead man is on the floor. </p>

<p>At this point, there are lots of options; natural causes, suicide, murder, and so on. But, that the dead body is on the floor is beyond dispute. Beyond that, you can start doing <a href="/pan/evolution/timely_science">forensic science</a> to gather data and figure out if it was more likely (&quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;) that he was killed by his wife to collect the insurance money, or he choked on a bagel.</p>

<p>Most of these kinds of technical rejections of evolution have the problem that they&#39;re saying &quot;because I&#39;m not sure exactly how this guy ended up dead, I&#39;m not going to deal with the fact that he&#39;s dead at all.&quot; The physical evidence that evolution, or something extremely like it, happened are overwhelming. Even if we&#39;re not talking evolution -- just &quot;there were lots of species that at some point lived on the earth and are now extinct&quot;, a fact you can establish reasonably well with a trip to a natural history museum -- there&#39;s a dead body in the room, which needs to be explained.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also pretty clear that most people who object to evolution do so only because they find it theologically challenging. I don&#39;t often hear people debating the evidence for, say, the theory of gravity in the same way.</p>

<p>Gravity is a dead body problem as well, in fact. While the effects of gravity are very well understood -- people only jump of bridges who mean to -- the mechanisms behind it are still under heavy, expensive investigation.</p>

<p>Likewise with evolution. There&#39;s so much evidence that it happened, but how some specific things work is still being explored, discovered, and theorized about. I&#39;ve seen discussions about things like &quot;what&#39;s more important, mutation, sexual selection, or genetic drift?&quot; &quot;What kinds of environments cause punctuated equilibrium, and is that even a valid concept?&quot; &quot;How did some specific structure evolve? What were the individual changes which, at each stage of development, would have been beneficial to that species?&quot;</p>

<p>These conversations are way in the margins, though, of the massive body of evidence that this process generally happened. And if any of them, in your mind, is amplified enough to challenge the whole idea, then write it up, get it peer reviewed, and collect your Nobel! But if that&#39;s not on the table, at least present a coherent reason for the clear evidence to be there, fit it into a story that makes some degree of sense, and let&#39;s discuss. (And <a href="/pan/gods_free_pass/">&#39;God can do whatever he wants!&#39;</a> is not a coherent reason.)</p></div>
